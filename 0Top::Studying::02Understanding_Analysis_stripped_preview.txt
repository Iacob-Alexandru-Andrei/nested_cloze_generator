    Theorem 1.1.1. There is no {{c5::{{c1::rational}}}} number whose {{c4::{{c3::square}}}} is {{c4::{{c2::2.}}}}

============================================================

  

    Theorem 1.1.1. There is no rational number whose square is 2.<br><br>Proof:<br><br>And so assume, for contradiction, that there exist integers \(p\) and \(q\) satisfying<br><br><ul><li>{{c1::\(\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2\)}} = 2<br></li></ul><br>We may also assume that \(p\) and \(q\) have {{c2::no common factor}}, because, {{c2::if they had one}}, we could simply {{c2::cancel it out and rewrite the fraction in lowest terms}}. Now, equation (1) implies<br><br><ul><li>{{c3::\(p^2\)}} =&nbsp;{{c4::\(2 q^2\)}}<br></li></ul><br>From this, we can see that the integer \(p^{2}\) is an {{c5::even number (it is divisible by 2 )}}, and hence \(p\) must be {{c5::even}} as well because the square of an {{c5::odd}} number is {{c5::odd}}. This allows us to write \(p\) = {{c5::\(2 r\)}}, where \(r\) is also an integer. If we substitute \(2 r\) for \(p\) in equation (2), then a little algebra yields the relationship<br><br><ul><li>{{c5::\(2 r^{2}\)}} = {{c5::\(q^{2}\)}}</li></ul><br>But now the absurdity is at hand. This last equation implies that \(q^{2}\) is {{c5::even}}, and hence \(q\) must also be {{c5::even}}. Thus, we have shown that \(p\) and \(q\) are both {{c5::even}}&nbsp; when they were originally assumed to have no common factor.&nbsp;<br>

    Why did the proof of irrationaliyt of the quare root challenge the mathematical notions of the greeks?<br><ul><li>They assumed numbers were only the {{c1::rational}} numbers</li><li>However, the square root of two existed as a {{c2::geometric length}} for the {{c5::{{c3::diagonal of a square}}}} and was {{c1::irrational}}</li><li>Figure:</li><li>{{c5::{{c4::<img src="paste-d4d930fe7d60937f0aab2a36f1e3b92f76739711.jpg">}}}}<br></li></ul>

============================================================

  

    If we restrict our attention to the natural numbers \(\mathbf{N}\), then we can perform {{c3::addition}} perfectly well, but we must extend our system to the integers<br><br><ul><li>{{c2::\(\mathbf{Z}\)}} = {{c1::\(\{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots\}\)}}</li></ul>if we want to have an {{c4::additive identity (zero)}} and the {{c5::additive inverses}} necessary to define {{c5::subtraction}}.<br>

============================================================

  

    The next issue after addtion (what the integers get us) is {{c1::multiplication}} and {{c2::division}}. The number {{c3::1}} acts as the {{c1::multiplicative}} {{c3::identity}}, but in order to define {{c2::division}} we need to have {{c1::multiplicative}} {{c4::inverses}}. Thus, we extend our system again to the rational numbers<br><br><ul><li>\(\mathbf{Q}\) = {{c5::<ul><li>\(\left\{\text { all fractions } \frac{p}{q} \text { where } p \text { and } q \text { are integers with } q \neq 0\right\}\)</li></ul>}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Taken together, the properties of Q:<br><ul><li>Closed under {{c1::addtion}}</li><li>{{c1::Addivite}} {{c2::identiy}}</li><li>{{c1::Addivitve}} {{c3::inverse}}</li><li>Closed under {{c4::multiplication}}</li><li>{{c4::Multiplicative}} {{c2::identity}}</li><li>{{c4::Multiplicative}} {{c3::inverse}}</li></ul><div>make Q into a {{c5::field}}</div>

============================================================

  

    The set \(\mathbf{Q}\) also has a {{c5::{{c1::natural}}}} {{c4::{{c2::order}}}} defined on it. Given any two rational numbers \(r\) and \(s\), exactly one of the following is true:<br><br><ul><li>\(r\) {{c4::{{c3::&lt;}}}}&nbsp;\(s\)<br></li><li>\(r\) {{c4::{{c3::=}}}}&nbsp;\(s\)<br></li><li>\(r\)&nbsp;{{c4::{{c3::\(&gt;\)}}}}&nbsp;\(s\)<br></li></ul>

============================================================

  

    The set \(\mathbf{Q}\) also has a natural order defined on it. Given any two rational numbers \(r\) and \(s\), exactly one of the following is true:<br><br>\[<br>r&lt;s, \quad r=s, \quad \text { or } \quad r&gt;s \text {. }<br>\]<br><br><ul><li>This ordering is {{c1::transitive}} in the sense that if {{c2::\(r&lt;s\)}} and {{c2::\(s&lt;t\)}}, then {{c2::\(r&lt;t\)}}<br></li><li>So we are conveniently led to a mental picture of the rational numbers as being laid out {{c3::from left to right along a number line}}.&nbsp;</li><li>Unlike \(\mathbf{Z}\), there are no {{c4::intervals of empty space}}.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Given any two rational numbers \(r&lt;s\), the rational number {{c5::\((r+s) / 2\)}} sits {{c5::halfway in between}}, implying that the rational numbers are {{c5::densely nestled together.}}</li></ul></ul><br>

============================================================

  

    Using only rational numbers, it is possible to approximate \(\sqrt{2}\) quite wel as can be seen in the figure:<br><ul><li>{{c1::<img src="paste-478bdc81f23e35bfd74dc9d56202ad66dd69458d.jpg">}}<br></li><li>For instance, \(1.414^{2}=1.999396\).&nbsp;</li><li>By adding more decimal places to our approximation, we can get even closer to a value for \(\sqrt{2}\),</li><li>Even so, we are now well aware that there is a "{{c2::hole}}" in the {{c2::rational number}} line where {{c3::\(\sqrt{2}\) ought to be.&nbsp;}}</li><li>Returning to the dilemma of the ancient Greek mathematicians, if we want {{c4::every length along the number line}} to correspond to {{c5::an actual number}}, then another extension to our number system is in order. Thus, to the chain \(\mathbf{N} \subseteq \mathbf{Z} \subseteq \mathbf{Q}\) we append the {{c5::real}} numbers {{c5::\(\mathbf{R}\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Intuitively speaking, a {{c1::set}} is {{c2::any collection of objects}}. These {{c2::objects}} are referred to as the {{c3::elements}} of the {{c1::set}}. For our purposes, the {{c1::sets}} in question will most often be {{c1::sets}} of {{c4::real numbers}}, although we will also encounter {{c1::sets}} of {{c5::functions}} and, on a few occasions, {{c1::sets}} whose {{c3::elements}} are {{c1::other sets.}}

============================================================

  

    Given a set \(A\), we write {{c1::\(x \in A\)}}&nbsp;if \(x\)(whatever it may be) is {{c2::an element of \(A\)}}. If \(x\) is {{c5::{{c3::not an element of \(A\)}}}}, then we write {{c5::{{c4::\(x \notin A\)}}}}

============================================================

  

    Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), the {{c2::union}} is written {{c1::\(A \cup B\)}} and is defined by asserting that<br><br>{{c3::\[<br>x \in A \cup B \text { provided that } x \in A \text { or } x \in B \text { (or potentially both). }<br>\]}}<br><br>The {{c4::intersection}} {{c1::\(A \cap B\)}} is the set defined by the rule<br><br>{{c5::\[<br>x \in A \cap B \text { provided } x \in A \text { and } x \in B \text {. }<br>\]}}

============================================================

  

    (iii) Sometimes it is more efficient to provide a kind of rule or algorithm for determining the elements of a set. As an example, let<br><ul><li>\(S\) = {{c1::\(\left\{r \in \mathbf{Q}: r^{2}&lt;2\right\}\)}}<br></li></ul><br>Read aloud, the definition of \(S\) says, "Let \(S\) be the set of {{c2::all}} {{c3::rational numbers}} whose {{c4::squares}} are {{c5::less than 2}}."&nbsp;<br>

============================================================

  

    The set {{c1::\(\emptyset\)}} is called {{c2::the empty set}} and is understood to be the set that {{c3::contains no elements}}. An equivalent statement would be to say that two sets whose {{c5::intersection}} is&nbsp; {{c1::\(\emptyset\)}}&nbsp; are {{c4::disjoint}}.

============================================================

  

    <ul><li>The {{c1::inclusion}} relationship {{c2::\(A \subseteq B\)}} or {{c2::\(B \supseteq A\)}} is used to indicate that {{c3::every element of \(A\)}} is {{c4::also an element of \(B\)}}.&nbsp;<br></li><li>In this case, we say \(A\) is a {{c5::subset}} of \(B\), or \(B\) {{c5::contains}} \(A\). To assert that \(A=B\) means that {{c2::\(A \subseteq B\)}} {{c5::and}} {{c2::\(B \subseteq A\)}}.&nbsp;</li><li>Put another way, \(A\) and \(B\) have {{c5::exactly the same elements.}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Example 1.2.2. Let<br><br>\[<br>\begin{aligned}<br>&amp; A_{1}=\mathbf{N}=\{1,2,3, \ldots\}, \\<br>&amp; A_{2}=\{2,3,4, \ldots\}, \\<br>&amp; A_{3}=\{3,4,5, \ldots\},<br>\end{aligned}<br>\]<br><br>and, in general, for each \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), define the set<br><br>\[<br>A_{n}=\{n, n+1, n+2, \ldots\} .<br>\]<br><br>The result is a nested chain of sets<br><br>\[<br>A_{1} \supseteq A_{2} \supseteq A_{3} \supseteq A_{4} \supseteq \cdots,<br>\]<br><br>where each successive set is a subset of all the previous ones. Notationally,<br><br>{{c1::\[<br>\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n}, \quad \bigcup_{n \in \mathbf{N} } A_{n}, \quad \text { or } \quad A_{1} \cup A_{2} \cup A_{3} \cup \cdots<br>\]}}<br><br>are all equivalent ways to indicate the set whose elements consist of {{c2::any element}} that {{c3::appears in at least one particular \(A_{n}\)}}. <br><br>Because of the nested property of this particular collection of sets, it is not too hard to see that<br><br><ul><li>{{c3::\(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n}\)}} = {{c4::\(A_{1}\)}}</li></ul><br>The notion of {{c5::intersection}} has the same kind of natural extension to infinite collections of sets. For this example, we have<br><br><ul><li>{{c5::\(\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n}\)}} = {{c4::\(\emptyset\)}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Given \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\), the {{c1::complement}} of \(A\), written {{c2::\(A^{c}\)}}, refers to the set of {{c5::{{c3::all elements of \(\mathbf{R}\) not in \(A\)}}}}. Thus, for \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\),<br><br><ul><li>{{c2::\(A^{c}\)}} = {{c5::{{c4::\(\{x \in \mathbf{R}: x \notin A\} .\)}}}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    A few times in our work to come, we will refer to {{c5::{{c3::De Morgan's Laws}}}}, which state that:<br><ul><li>{{c4::{{c1::\((A \cap B)^c\)}}}} = {{c4::{{c2::\(A^c \cup B^c\)}}}}<br></li></ul>

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition 1.2.3:</b><br><ul><li>Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), a {{c1::function}} from \(A\) to \(B\) is a {{c2::rule}} or {{c2::mapping}} that {{c3::takes each element \(x \in A\)}} and {{c4::associates with it}} {{c5::a single element of \(B\).&nbsp;}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition 1.2.3:</b><br><ul><li>Given two sets \(A\) and \(B\), a function from \(A\) to \(B\) is a rule or mapping that takes each element \(x \in A\) and associates with it a single element of \(B\).&nbsp;</li><li>In this case, we write {{c1::\(f: A \rightarrow B\).}}</li><li>Given {{c3::an element \(x \in A\)}}, the expression {{c2::\(f(x)\)}} is used to represent {{c4::the element of \(B\)}} {{c5::associated with \(x\) by \(f\).&nbsp;}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition 1.2.3:</b><br><ul><li>The set \(A\) is called the {{c1::domain}} of \(f\).&nbsp;<br></li><li>The {{c2::range of \(f\)}} is not necessarily {{c3::equal to \(B\)}} {{c5::but refers to the subset of \(B\)}} given by {{c4::\(\{y \in B: y=f(x)\)}} for {{c5::some \(x \in A\}\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Example 1.2.4. In 1829, Dirichlet proposed the unruly function<br><br><ul><li>\(g(x) \) =&nbsp; {{c5::{{c3::\(\begin{cases}1 &amp; \text { if } x \in \mathbf{Q} \\ 0 &amp; \text { if } x \notin \mathbf{Q}\end{cases}\)}}}}</li></ul><br>The domain of \(g\) is all of \(\mathbf{R}\), and the range is the set \(\{0,1\}\). There is {{c4::{{c1::no single formula for \(g\)}}}} in the usual sense, and it is quite difficult to {{c4::{{c2::graph}}}} this function (see Section 4.1 for a rough attempt), but it certainly qualifies as a function<br>

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;The {{c2::absolute value}} function is so important that it merits the special notation {{c2::\(|x|\)}} in place of the usual \(f(x)\) or \(g(x)\). It is defined for every real number via the piecewise definition<br><br><ul><li>{{c2::\(|x|\)}} =&nbsp; {{c1::\(\begin{cases}x &amp; \text { if } x \geq 0 \\ -x &amp; \text { if } x&lt;0\end{cases}\)}}</li></ul><br>With respect to multiplication and division, the {{c2::absolute value}} function satisfies<br><br><ul><li>(i) {{c4::\(|a b|\)}} {{c5::=}} {{c3::\(|a||b|\)}} and</li><li>(ii) {{c3::\(|a+b|\)&nbsp;}} {{c5::\(\leq\)}} {{c4::\(|a|+|b|\)}}</li></ul><br>for all choices of \(a\) and \(b\).&nbsp;<br>

============================================================

  

    Given three real numbers \(a, b\), and \(c\), we certainly have<br><br><ul><li>{{c1::\(|a-b|\)}}&nbsp;= {{c2::\(|(a-c)\)}} + {{c2::\((c-b)| \text {. }\)}}</li></ul><br>By the triangle inequality,<br><br><ul><li>{{c2::\(|(a-c)+(c-b)|\)}}&nbsp; \(\leq\) {{c3::\(|a-c|+|c-b|,\)}}</li></ul><br>so we get<br><ul><li>{{c1::\(|a-b| \)}} \(\leq\) {{c4::\(|a-c|\)}} + {{c4::\(|c-b| . \tag{1}\)}}</li></ul><br>Now, the expression \(|a-b|\) is equal to \(|b-a|\) and is best understood as the distance between the points \(a\) and \(b\) on the number line. With this interpretation, equation (1) makes the plausible statement that the distance from \(a\) to \(b\) is less than or equal to the {{c5::distance from \(a\) to \(c\)}} plus {{c5::the distance from \(c\) to \(b\).}} Pretending for a moment that these are points in the plane (instead of on the real line), it should be evident why this is referred to as the "triangle inequality."<br>

============================================================

  

    A {{c1::direct}} proof begins from {{c2::some valid statement}}, most often taken from the {{c3::theorem's hypothesis}}, and then proceeds through {{c4::rigorously logical deductions}} to a {{c5::demonstration of the theorem's conclusion}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    An {{c5::{{c1::indirect}}}} proof always begins by {{c4::{{c2::negating}}}} {{c4::{{c3::what it is we would like to prove.}}}}&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Theorem 1.2.6. Two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are equal if and only if for every {{c5::real number \(\epsilon\)}} {{c4::&gt;}} {{c3::\(0\)}} it follows that {{c2::\(|a-b|\)}} {{c4::\(&lt;\)}} {{c1::\(\epsilon\).}}

============================================================

  

    Theorem 1.2.6. Two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are equal if and only if for every real number \(\epsilon&gt;0\) it follows that \(|a-b|&lt;\epsilon\).<br><br><ul><li>For the proof of the first statement, there is really not much to say. If \(a=b\), then \(|a-b|\) = {{c5::{{c1::\(0\),}}}} and so certainly \(|a-b|\) {{c4::{{c2::\(&lt;\) \(\epsilon\)}}}} no matter what {{c4::{{c3::\(\epsilon&gt;0\) is chosen.}}}}</li></ul>

    <b>Theorem 1.2.6. </b>Two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are equal if and only if for every real number \(\epsilon&gt;0\) it follows that \(|a-b|&lt;\epsilon\).<br><br><ul><li>For the second statement, we give a proof by contradiction. The conclusion of the proposition in this direction states that \(a=b\), so we assume that {{c1::\(a \neq b\)}}.&nbsp;</li><li>Heading off in search of a contradiction brings us to a consideration of the phrase "for every \(\epsilon&gt;0\)." Some equivalent ways to state the hypothesis would be to say that "for all possible choices of \(\epsilon&gt;0\) " or "no matter how \(\epsilon&gt;0\) is selected, it is always the case that \(|a-b|&lt;\epsilon\)."&nbsp;</li><li>But assuming {{c1::\(a \neq b\)}} (as we are doing at the moment), the choice of</li><ul><li>\(\epsilon_{0}\) = {{c2::\(|a-b|&gt;0\)}}</li><li>poses a serious problem.&nbsp;</li></ul><li>We are assuming that {{c3::\(|a-b|&lt;\epsilon\)}} is true for {{c3::every \(\epsilon&gt;0\)}}, so this must certainly be true of the particular \(\epsilon_{0}\) just defined.&nbsp;</li><li>However, the statements:</li><ul><li>\(|a-b|\) \(&lt;\) {{c4::\(\epsilon_{0}\)&nbsp;}}</li><li>\(|a-b|\) {{c5::= \(\epsilon_{0}\)}}</li></ul><li>cannot {{c5::both be true}}.&nbsp;</li><li>This contradiction means that our initial assumption that \(a \neq b\) is unacceptable.&nbsp;</li><li>Therefore, \(a=b\), and the indirect proof is complete.<br></li></ul>

============================================================

  

    An important lesson to take from Example 1.3.3 is that {{c1::\(\sup A\)}} and {{c2::\(\inf A\)}} {{c3::may}} or {{c4::may not}} be {{c5::elements of the set \(A\)}}. This issue is tied to understanding the crucial difference between the {{c5::maximum}} and the {{c1::supremum}}&nbsp;&nbsp;of a given set.

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition 1.3.4.</b><br><ul><li>&nbsp;A real number \(a_{0}\) is a {{c1::maximum}} of the set \(A\) if \(a_{0}\) is an {{c3::element of \(A\)}} and \(a_{0}\) {{c2::\(\geq\)}} {{c4::\(a\)}} for {{c5::all \(a \in A\)}}.&nbsp;</li><li>Similarly, a number \(a_{1}\) is a {{c1::minimum}} of \(A\) if \(a_{1}\) {{c3::\(\in\) \(A\)}} and \(a_{1}\) {{c2::\(\leq\)}} {{c4::\(a\)}} for {{c5::every \(a \in A\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Example 1.3.5. To belabor the point, consider the open interval<br><br>\[<br>(0,2)=\{x \in \mathbf{R}: 0&lt;x&lt;2\},<br>\]<br><br>and the closed interval<br><br>\[<br>[0,2]=\{x \in \mathbf{R}: 0 \leq x \leq 2\} .<br>\]<br><br>Both sets are bounded above (and below), and both have the same least upper bound, namely 2 . It is not the case, however, that both sets have a {{c4::maximum}}. A {{c4::maximum}} is a specific type of upper bound that is required to be {{c1::an element of the set in question}}, and the open interval \((0,2)\) does {{c5::{{c2::not possess such an element}}}}. Thus, the {{c5::{{c3::supremum}}}} can exist and not be a {{c4::maximum}}, but when a {{c4::maximum}} exists, then it is also the {{c3::supremum}}.

============================================================

  

    The axiom of {{c1::completeness}} if {{c2::not}} {{c4::a valid statement}} on {{c3::Q}}, unlike {{c5::R}}

============================================================

  

    Example 1.3.6. Consider again the set<br><br>\[<br>S=\left\{r \in \mathbf{Q}: r^{2}&lt;2\right\},<br>\]<br><br><ul><li>and pretend for the moment that our world consists only of {{c1::rational}} numbers.&nbsp;</li><li>The set \(S\) is certainly bounded above. Taking \(b=2\) works, as does \(b=3 / 2\). But notice what happens as we go in search of the least upper bound. (It may be useful here to know that the decimal expansion for \(\sqrt{2}\) begins \(1.4142 \ldots\). .)&nbsp;</li><li>We might try \(b=142 / 100\), which is indeed an upper bound, but then we discover that \(b=1415 / 1000\) is an upper bound that is {{c4::smaller still}}. Is there a {{c4::smallest}} one?</li><li>In the {{c1::rational}} numbers, there {{c2::is not.}} In the {{c3::real}} numbers, there is.&nbsp;</li><li>Back in \(\mathbf{R}\), the Axiom of {{c5::Completeness}} states that we may set \(\alpha=\sup S\) and be confident that such a number exists.&nbsp;</li><li>In the next section, we will prove that \(\alpha^{2}=2\). But according to Theorem 1.1.1, this implies \(\alpha\) is not a {{c1::rational}} number.&nbsp;</li><li>If we are restricting our attention to only {{c1::rational}} numbers, then \(\alpha\) is not an allowable option for \(\sup S\), and the search for a least upper bound {{c5::goes on indefinitely.}}&nbsp;</li><li>Whatever {{c1::rational}} upper bound is discovered, it is always possible to {{c4::find one smaller.}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Example 1.3.7. Let \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) be {{c5::nonempty}} and {{c5::bounded above}}, and let \(c \in \mathbf{R}\). Define the set {{c2::\(c+A\)}} by<br><br><ul><li>{{c2::\(c+A\)}} = {{c4::\(\{c+a: a \in A\} .\)}}</li><li>Then {{c3::\(\sup\)}} {{c2::\((c+A)\)}} = {{c1::\(c+\sup A\).}}</li></ul>

    <b>Lemma</b> 1.3.8:<br><ul><li>Assume \(s \in \mathbf{R}\) is an upper bound for a set \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\).&nbsp;</li><li>Then, \(s\) = {{c5::\(\sup A\)}} if and only if, for {{c3::every choice of \(\epsilon\)}} {{c4::\(&gt;\) \(0\)}}, there exists an {{c3::element \(a\) \(\in\) \(A\)}} satisfying {{c2::\(s-\epsilon\)}} {{c1::\(&lt;a\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Lemma 1.3.8. Assume \(s \in \mathbf{R}\) is an upper bound for a set \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\). Then, \(s=\sup A\) if and only if, for every choice of \(\epsilon&gt;0\), there exists an element \(a \in A\) satisfying \(s-\epsilon&lt;a\).<br><br>Proof. Here is a short rephrasing of the lemma: Given that \(s\) is an upper bound, \(s\) is the {{c4::least upper bound}} if and only if {{c3::any}} number {{c5::{{c2::smaller than \(s\)}}}} is {{c5::{{c1::not an upper bound.&nbsp;}}}}

============================================================

  

    It is certainly the case that all of our conclusions to this point about least upper bounds have analogous versions for {{c1::greatest lower bounds}}. The Axiom of Completeness does not explicitly assert that a {{c2::nonempty}} set {{c5::{{c3::bounded below}}}} has an {{c5::{{c4::infimum}}}}, but this is because we do not need to assume this fact as part of the axiom. Using the Axiom of Completeness, there are several ways to prove that {{c1::greatest lower bounds}} exist for {{c2::nonempty}} {{c5::{{c3::bounded}}}} sets.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition 1.3.2</b>. A real number \(i\) is the {{c3::greatest lower bound}} or {{c4::infimum}} for a set \(A\) \(\subseteq\) {{c5::\( \mathbf{R}\)}} if it meets the following two criteria:<ul><li>(i) \(i\) is a {{c1::lower bound}} for \(A\);</li><li>(ii) if \(b\) is any {{c1::lower bound}} for \(A\), then \(i\) {{c2::\(\geq\) \(b\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    A function \(f: A \rightarrow B\) that is both {{c1::1-1}} and {{c2::onto}} provides us with exactly what we mean by a {{c3::\(1-1\) correspondence}} between two sets. The property of being {{c1::1-1}} means that {{c4::no two elements of \(A\) correspond to the same element of \(B\)}} , and the property of being {{c2::onto}} ensures that {{c5::every element of \(B\) corresponds to something in \(A\)}}&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition</b> 1.5.2. The set \(A\) has {{c5::{{c3::the same cardinality}}}} as \(B\) if there exists \(f: A \rightarrow B\) that is {{c4::{{c1::\(1-1\)}}}} and {{c4::{{c2::onto}}}}. In this case, we write \(A\) {{c5::{{c3::\(\sim\)}}}} \(B\).

============================================================

  

    Example 1.5.3. (i) If we let \(E=\{2,4,6, \ldots\}\) be the set of even natural numbers, then we can show {{c4::\(\mathbf{N}\)}} {{c3::\(\sim\) \(E\)}}.

    (ii) To make this point again, note that although \(\mathbf{N}\) is contained in \(\mathbf{Z}\) as a proper subset, we can show \(\mathbf{N}\)&nbsp; {{c2::\(\sim\)}} \(\mathbf{Z}\). This time le<br><br><ul><li>f(n) = {{c1::\(\begin{cases}(n-1) / 2 &amp; \text { if } n \text { is odd } \\ -n / 2 &amp; \text { if } n \text { is even. }\end{cases}\)}}</li></ul><br>The important details to verify are that \(f\) does {{c4::not map any two natural numbers to the same element of \(\mathbf{Z}\)}} ( \(f\) is {{c4::1-1}}) and that {{c5::every element of \(\mathbf{Z}\) gets "hit" by something in \(\mathbf{N}\)}} ( \(f\) is {{c5::onto}}).<br><br>{{c3::\[<br>\begin{array}{lcccccccc}<br>\mathbf{N}: &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; \cdots \\<br>&amp; \uparrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \uparrow &amp; \downarrow &amp; \uparrow &amp; \\<br>\mathbf{Z}: &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; -3 &amp; 3 &amp; \cdots<br>\end{array}<br>\]}}<br>

============================================================

  

    Example 1.5.4. A little calculus (which we will not supply) shows that the function \(f(x)\) = {{c2::\(x\)}} {{c3::\(/\)}} {{c1::\(\left(x^{2}-1\right)\)}} takes the interval {{c4::\((-1,1)\)}} onto \(\mathbf{R}\) in a \(1-1\) fashion (Fig. 1.4).

If we let \(x_{1}=f(1), x_{2}=f(2)\), and so on, then our assumption that \(f\) is onto means that we can write<br><br>\[<br>\begin{equation*}<br>\mathbf{R}=\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, \ldots\right\} \tag{1}<br>\end{equation*}<br>\]<br><br>and be confident that every real number appears somewhere on the list.

    Given a set \(A\), the {{c1::power set \(P(A)\)}} refers to {{c2::the collection of all subsets of \(A\)}}. It is important to understand that {{c1::\(P(A)\)}} is {{c5::{{c3::itself considered a set}}}} {{c5::{{c4::whose elements are the different possible subsets of \(A\).}}}}

    Whereas mapping \(A\) {{c1::into}} {{c2::\(P(A)\)}} is quite {{c5::{{c4::effortless}}}}, finding an {{c5::{{c3::onto}}}} map is {{c5::{{c4::impossible}}}}.

This proof, like the others of its kind, is indirect. Thus, assume, for contradiction, that \(f: A \rightarrow P(A)\) is onto. Unlike the usual situation in which we have sets of numbers for the domain and range, \(f\) is a correspondence between a set and its power set.

============================================================

  

    {{c5::Cantor's}} Theorem states that there is {{c4::no}} {{c2::onto}} function from \(\mathbf{N}\) to {{c1::\(P(\mathbf{N})\)}}; in other words, the {{c1::power set of the natural numbers}} is {{c3::uncountable}}.

============================================================

  

    The {{c4::cardinality}} of {{c1::the power set of N}} and the cardinality of {{c2::R}} are {{c3::the same}} and they are {{c5::both uncountable}}

============================================================

  

    (c) Given a set \(B\), a subset \(\mathcal{A}\) of {{c2::\(P(B)\)}} is called an {{c1::antichain}} if no element of \(\mathcal{A}\) is {{c5::{{c3::a subset}}}} {{c5::{{c4::of any other element of \(\mathcal{A}\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    The relationship of having the {{c5::same cardinality}} is an {{c1::equivalence}} relation (see Exercise 1.5.5), meaning, roughly, that {{c4::all of the sets in the mathematical universe}} can be organized into {{c2::disjoint groups}} according to {{c3::their size}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Two sets appear in the {{c4::same}} {{c1::group}}, or {{c2::equivalence class}}, if and only if they have the {{c4::same}} {{c3::cardinality}}. Thus, {{c4::\(\mathbf{N}, \mathbf{Z}\)}}, and {{c5::\(\mathbf{Q}\)}} are grouped together in one class with all of the&nbsp;other countable sets, whereas {{c5::\(\mathbf{R}\)}} is in another class that includes the {{c5::intervals \((a, b)\)}} as well as {{c5::\(P(\mathbf{N})\).}}&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;One implication of Cantor's Theorem is that {{c1::\(P(\mathbf{R})\)}} - the {{c2::set of all subsets of \(\mathbf{R}\)}} - is in a {{c3::different class}} from {{c2::\(\mathbf{R}\)}}, and there is no reason to stop here. The {{c2::set of subsets of \(P(\mathbf{R})\)}} - namely {{c4::\(P(P(\mathbf{R}))\)}} - is {{c5::in yet another class}}, and {{c5::this process continues indefinitely.}}

============================================================

  

    Having divided the universe of sets into disjoint groups, it would be convenient to attach {{c5::a "number" to each collection}} which could be used the way {{c5::natural numbers are used to refer to the sizes of finite sets}}. Given a set \(X\), there exists something called the {{c1::cardinal number}} of \(X\), denoted {{c2::\(\operatorname{card} X\)}}, which behaves very much in this fashion. For instance, two sets \(X\) and \(Y\) satisfy {{c3::card \(X=\) card \(Y\)}} if and only if {{c4::\(X \sim Y\)}}.

============================================================

  

    Looking back at Cantor's Theorem, we get the strong sense that there is an order on the sizes of infinite sets that should be reflected in our new cardinal number system. <br><br><ul><li>Specifically, if it is possible to map a set \(X\) into \(Y\) in a {{c1::1-1}} fashion, then we want card \(X\) {{c2::\(\leq\)}} \(\operatorname{card} Y\). Writing the {{c3::strict inequality}} card \(X\)&nbsp; {{c3::&lt;}} card \(Y\) should indicate that it is possible to map \(X\) {{c4::into}} \(Y\) but that {{c5::it is not the case}} that {{c4::\(X \sim Y\)}}. Restated in this notation, Cantor's Theorem states that for every set \(A, \operatorname{card} A\) &lt; {{c5::\(\operatorname{card} P(A)\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    There are some significant details to work out. A kind of metaphysical problem arises when we realize that an implication of Cantor's Theorem is that there can be no "{{c5::{{c1::largest}}}}" set. A declaration such as, "Let \(U\) be the set of {{c4::{{c2::all possible thing}}}}s," is paradoxical because we immediately get that \(\operatorname{card} U\) &lt; {{c4::{{c3::\(\operatorname{card} P(U)\)}}}}&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    A more downto-earth problem in need of attention is demonstrating that our definition of " \(\leq\) " between cardinal numbers really is an ordering. This involves showing that cardinal numbers possess a property analogous to real numbers, which states that if \(\operatorname{card} X \leq \operatorname{card} Y\) and \(\operatorname{card} Y \leq \operatorname{card} X\), then \(\operatorname{card} X=\operatorname{card} Y\). In the end, this boils down to proving that if there exists {{c2::\(f: X \rightarrow Y\)}} that is {{c1::\(1-1\)}}, and if there exists {{c3::\(g: Y \rightarrow X\)}} that is {{c1::\(1-1\)}}, then it is possible to find a function {{c5::\(h: X \rightarrow Y\)}} that is both {{c1::1-1}} and {{c4::onto}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Cantor's "continuum hypothesis," as it came to be called, was one of the most famous mathematical challenges of the past century. Its unexpected resolution came in two parts. In 1940, the German logician and mathematician Kurt Gödel demonstrated that, using only the agreed-upon set of axioms of set theory, there was no way to disprove the continuum hypothesis. In 1963, Paul Cohen successfully showed that, under the same rules, it was also impossible to prove this conjecture. Taken together, what these two discoveries imply is that the continuum hypothesis is undecidable. It can be {{c5::{{c2::accepted}}}} or {{c4::{{c3::rejected}}}} as a statement about the nature of infinite sets, and in neither case will any {{c4::{{c1::logical contradictions}}}} arise.

One immediate observation is that the successive sums oscillate in a {{c5::progressively narrower space.}} The {{c4::odd}} sums decrease \(\left(s_{1}&gt;s_{3}&gt;s_{5}&gt;\ldots\right)\) while the {{c4::even}} sums increase \(\left(s_{2}&lt;s_{4}&lt;s_{6}&lt;\ldots\right.\) ).

    Example 2.2.6. Show<br><br>\[<br>\lim \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)=1<br>\]<br><br>As mentioned, before attempting a formal proof, we first need to do some preliminary scratch work.

    Example 2.2.6. Show<br><br>\[<br>\lim \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\right)=1<br>\]<br><br>Proof. Let \(\epsilon&gt;0\) be arbitrary. Choose \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) with {{c5::{{c2::\(N&gt;1 / \epsilon\)}}}}. To verify that this choice of \(N\) is appropriate, let \(n \in \mathbf{N}\) satisfy \(n \geq N\). Then, {{c4::{{c1::\(n \geq N\)}}}} implies {{c5::{{c2::\(n&gt;1 / \epsilon\)}}}}, which is the same as saying {{c4::{{c3::\(1 / n&lt;\epsilon\)}}}}. Finally, this means<br><br>\[<br>\left|\frac{n+1}{n}-1\right|&lt;\epsilon<br>\]<br><br>as desired.

    <b>Theorem 2.2.7</b> ({{c1::Uniqueness}} of {{c2::Limits}}). The {{c2::limit}} of a {{c5::{{c4::sequence}}}}, when {{c5::{{c3::it exists}}}}, must be {{c1::unique}}.

============================================================

  

    To prove that a particular number \(x\) is {{c3::not}} the {{c4::limit}} of a sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\), we must produce a {{c5::{{c1::single value of \(\epsilon\)}}}} for which {{c5::{{c2::no \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) works}}}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Example 2.2.8. Consider the sequence<br><br>\[<br>\left(1,-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3},-\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \cdots\right) \text {. }<br>\]<br><br>We have argued that the preceding sequence does not converge to 0 . Let's argue against the claim that it converges to {{c1::\(1 / 5\)}}. Choosing \(\epsilon=1 / 10\) produces the neighborhood {{c5::\((1 / 10,3 / 10)\)}}. Although the sequence {{c2::continually revisits}} this neighborhood, there is no point at which it {{c3::enters}} and {{c4::never leaves}} as the definition requires.&nbsp;

    Exercise 2.2.7. Here are two useful definitions:<br><br><ul><li>(i) A sequence \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) is {{c1::eventually}} in a set \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) if {{c2::there exists}} an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that \(a_{n}\) {{c3::\(\in A\)}} for {{c4::all \(n \geq N\)}}.</li><li>(ii) A sequence \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) is {{c1::frequently}} in a set \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) if, for {{c5::every \(N \in \mathbf{N}\)}}, {{c2::there exists}} {{c4::an \(n \geq N\)}} such that \(a_{n}\) {{c3::\(\in A\)}}.</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Definition 2.3.1. A sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) is bounded if there exists a number \(M&gt;0\) such that \(\left|x_{n}\right| \leq M\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\).<br><br>{{c5::{{c3::Geometrically}}}}, this means that we can find {{c4::{{c1::an interval \([-M, M]\)}}}} that {{c4::{{c2::contains every term in the sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.3.2. Every convergent sequence is bounded.<br><br>Proof. Assume \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) converges to a limit \(l\). This means that given a particular value of \(\epsilon\), say \(\epsilon=1\), we know there must exist an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that if \(n \geq N\), then \(x_{n}\) is in the interval {{c1::\((l-1, l+1)\)}}. Not knowing whether \(l\) is positive or negative, we can certainly conclude that<br><ul><li>{{c2::\(\left|x_{n}\right|\)}} &lt; {{c1::\(|l|+1\)}}<br></li></ul><br>for all \(n \geq N\) as shown in the figure<br>{{c5::{{c3::<br><img src="paste-515c094bd5b761e5a75a79ed5446007b6f07cc0f.jpg">}}}}<br>We still need to worry (slightly) about the terms in the sequence that come before the \(N\) th term.

    Theorem 2.3.3 (Algebraic Limit Theorem). Let \(\lim a_{n}=a\), and \(\lim b_{n}=\) b. Then,<br><ol><li>(i) \(\lim \left(c a_{n}\right)=c a\), for all \(c \in \mathbf{R}\);</li></ol>Proof. (i) Consider the case where \(c \neq 0\). We want to show that the sequence \(\left(c a_{n}\right)\) converges to \(c a\), so the structure of the proof follows the template we described in Section 2.2. First, we let \(\epsilon\) be some arbitrary positive number. Our goal is to find some point in the sequence \(\left(c a_{n}\right)\) after which we have<br><br><ul><li>{{c1::\(\left|c a_{n}-c a\right|\)}} &lt; \(\epsilon\)</li></ul><br>Now,<br><br><ul><li>{{c1::\(\left|c a_{n}-c a\right|\)}} = {{c2::\(|c|\left|a_{n}-a\right| .\)}}</li></ul><br>We are given that \(\left(a_{n}\right) \rightarrow a\), so we know we can make \(\left|a_{n}-a\right|\) as small as we like. In particular, we can choose an \(N\) such that<br><br><ul><li>{{c3::\(\left|a_{n}-a\right|\)}} \(&lt;\) {{c4::\(\frac{\epsilon}{|c|}\)}}</li></ul><br>whenever \(n \geq N\). To see that this \(N\) indeed works, observe that, for all \(n \geq N\),<br><br><ul><li>{{c1::\(\left|c a_{n}-c a\right|\)}} = {{c2::\(|c|\left|a_{n}-a\right|\)}} &lt; {{c4::\(|c| \frac{\epsilon}{|c|}\)}} = {{c5::\(\epsilon\)}}</li></ul><br>The case \(c=0\) reduces to showing that the constant sequence \((0,0,0, \ldots)\) converges to 0 , which is easily verified.<br>

============================================================

  

    Before embarking on a formal argument, it is a good idea to take an inventory of what we want to make less than \(\epsilon\), and what we are given can be made small for suitable choices of \(n\). For the previous proof, we wanted to make \(\left|c a_{n}-c a\right|&lt;\epsilon\), and we were given \(\left|a_{n}-a\right|&lt;\) {{c1::anything we like}} (for {{c2::large values of \(n\)}} ). Notice that in (i), and all of the ensuing arguments, the strategy each time is to bound the quantity we want to be {{c4::less than \(\epsilon\)}}, which in each case is<br><br><ul><li>{{c3::\(\mid(\text { terms of sequence })-(\text { proposed limit }) \mid \text {, }\)}}</li></ul><br>with some {{c5::algebraic combination}} of {{c5::quantities}} over which {{c5::we have control.}}<br>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.3.3 (Algebraic Limit Theorem). Let \(\lim a_{n}=a\), and \(\lim b_{n}=\) b. Then,<br><br><ul><li>(i) \(\lim \left(c a_{n}\right)=c a\), for all \(c \in \mathbf{R}\);</li><li>(ii) \(\lim \left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right)=a+b\);</li><li>(iii) \(\lim \left(a_{n} b_{n}\right)=a b\);</li><li>(iv) \(\lim \left(a_{n} / b_{n}\right)=a / b\), provided \(b \neq 0\).</li></ul><br>(ii) To prove this statement, we need to argue that the quantity<br><br>\[<br>\left|\left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right)-(a+b)\right|<br>\]<br><br>can be made less than an arbitrary \(\epsilon\) using the assumptions that \(\left|a_{n}-a\right|\) and \(\left|b_{n}-b\right|\) can be made as small as we like for large \(n\). The first step is to use the triangle inequality (Example 1.2.5) to say<br><br><ul><li>\(\left|\left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right)-(a+b)\right|\) = \(\left|\left(a_{n}-a\right)+\left(b_{n}-b\right)\right|\) \(\leq\) {{c1::\(\left|a_{n}-a\right|+\left|b_{n}-b\right| .\)}}</li></ul><br>Again, we let \(\epsilon&gt;0\) be arbitrary. The technique this time is to {{c2::divide}} the \(\epsilon\) {{c3::between the two expressions}} on the right-hand side in the preceding inequality. Using the hypothesis that \(\left(a_{n}\right) \rightarrow a\), we know there exists an \(N_{1}\) such that<br><br><ul><li>\(\left|a_{n}-a\right|\) &lt; {{c4::\(\frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text { whenever } \quad n \geq N_{1} \text {. }\)}}</li></ul><br>Likewise, the assumption that \(\left(b_{n}\right) \rightarrow b\) means that we can choose an \(N_{2}\) so that<br><br><ul><li>\(\left|b_{n}-b\right|\) &lt; {{c4::\(\frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text { whenever } \quad n \geq N_{2}\)}}</li></ul><br>The question now arises as to which of {{c4::\(N_{1}\)}} or {{c4::\(N_{2}\)}} we should take to be our choice of \(N\). By choosing \(N\) = {{c5::\(\max \left\{N_{1}, N_{2}\right\}\)}}, we ensure that if \(n \geq N\), then \(n \geq N_{1}\) and \(n \geq N_{2}\). This allows us to conclude that<br><br>{{c5::\[<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\left|\left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right)-(a+b)\right| &amp; \leq\left|a_{n}-a\right|+\left|b_{n}-b\right| \\<br>&amp; &lt;\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon<br>\end{aligned}<br>\]}}<br><br>for all \(n \geq N\), as desired.<br>

============================================================

  

    (iii) To show that \(\left(a_{n} b_{n}\right) \rightarrow a b\), we begin by observing that<br><br>\[<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b\right| &amp; =\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b_{n}+a b_{n}-a b\right| \\<br>&amp; \leq\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b_{n}\right|+\left|a b_{n}-a b\right| \\<br>&amp; =\left|b_{n}\right|\left|a_{n}-a\right|+|a|\left|b_{n}-b\right| .<br>\end{aligned}<br>\]<br><br>In the initial step, we subtracted and then added \(a b_{n}\), which created an opportunity to use the triangle inequality. Essentially, we have {{c1::broken up the distance}} from {{c5::\(a_{n} b_{n}\)}} to {{c5::\(a b\)}} with a {{c2::midway point}} and are using the {{c3::sum of the two distances}} to {{c4::overestimate the original distance}}.

============================================================

  

    (iii) To show that \(\left(a_{n} b_{n}\right) \rightarrow a b\), we begin by observing that<br><br>\[<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b\right| &amp; =\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b_{n}+a b_{n}-a b\right| \\<br>&amp; \leq\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b_{n}\right|+\left|a b_{n}-a b\right| \\<br>&amp; =\left|b_{n}\right|\left|a_{n}-a\right|+|a|\left|b_{n}-b\right| .<br>\end{aligned}<br>\]<br><br>Letting \(\epsilon&gt;0\) be arbitrary, we again proceed with the strategy of making each piece in the preceding inequality less than \(\epsilon / 2\). For the piece on the right-hand side \(\left(|a|\left|b_{n}-b\right|\right)\), if \(a \neq 0\) we can choose \(N_{1}\) so that<br><br>\[<br>n \geq N_{1} \quad \text { implies } \quad\left|b_{n}-b\right|&lt;\frac{1}{|a|} \frac{\epsilon}{2} \text {. }<br>\]<br><br>Getting the term on the left-hand side \(\left(\left|b_{n}\right|\left|a_{n}-a\right|\right)\) to be less than \(\epsilon / 2\) is complicated by the fact that we have a {{c1::variable quantity}} \(\left|b_{n}\right|\) to contend with as opposed to the {{c2::constant \(|a|\)}} we encountered in the right-hand term. The idea is to replace \(\left|b_{n}\right|\) with a {{c3::worst-case estimate}}. Using the fact that convergent sequences are {{c4::bounded}} (Theorem 2.3.2), we know there exists a {{c4::bound \(M&gt;0\)}} satisfying \(\left|b_{n}\right|\) {{c4::\(\leq M\)}} for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\). Now, we can choose \(N_{2}\) so that<br><br><ul><li>\(\left|a_{n}-a\right|&lt;\) {{c5::\(\frac{1}{M} \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text { whenever } \quad n \geq N_{2}\)}}</li></ul><div>To finish the argument, pick \(N\) = \(\max \left\{N_{1}, N_{2}\right\}\), and observe that if \(n \geq N\), then<br><br>{{c5::\[<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b\right| &amp; \leq\left|a_{n} b_{n}-a b_{n}\right|+\left|a b_{n}-a b\right| \\<br>&amp; =\left|b_{n}\right|\left|a_{n}-a\right|+|a|\left|b_{n}-b\right| \\<br>&amp; \leq M\left|a_{n}-a\right|+|a|\left|b_{n}-b\right| \\<br>&amp; &lt;M\left(\frac{\epsilon}{M 2}\right)+|a|\left(\frac{\epsilon}{|a| 2}\right)=\epsilon .<br>\end{aligned}<br>\]}}<br></div>

To do this, we consider the particular value \(\epsilon\) = {{c2::\(|a|\)}}. The definition of convergence guarantees that we can find an \(N\) such that {{c5::{{c3::\(\left|a_{n}-a\right|\)}}}} &lt; {{c2::\(|a|\)}} for all \(n \geq N\). In particular, this would mean that {{c5::{{c3::\(\left|a_{N}-a\right|\)}}}} \(&lt;\) {{c2::\(|a|\)}}, which implies \(a_{N}\) &lt; \(0\). This contradicts our hypothesis that \(a_{N} \geq 0\).

    A word about the idea of "tails" is in order. Loosely speaking, limits and their properties do not depend at all on what happens {{c5::{{c1::at the beginning of the sequence}}}} but are {{c4::{{c2::strictly determined}}}} by what happens {{c4::{{c3::when \(n\) gets large}}}}.

============================================================

  

    Notice that the {{c3::order of the terms}} in a {{c4::subsequence}} is {{c5::{{c2::the same as in the original sequence}}}}, and repetitions are {{c5::{{c1::not allowed.&nbsp;}}}}<br>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.5.2. {{c3::Subsequences}} of a {{c4::convergent}} sequence {{c5::converge}} to {{c1::the same limit}} {{c2::as the original sequence.}}

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.5.2. Subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit as the original sequence.<br><br>Proof. Assume \(\left(a_{n}\right) \rightarrow a\), and let \(\left(a_{n_{k}}\right)\) be a subsequence. Given \(\epsilon&gt;0\), there exists \(N\) such that \(\left|a_{n}-a\right|&lt;\epsilon\) whenever \(n \geq N\). Because \(n_{k}\) {{c2::\(\geq k\)}} for all \(k\), the {{c1::same \(N\) will suffice for the subsequence}}; that is, {{c5::{{c3::\(\left|a_{n_{k} }-a\right|\) }}}} &lt; \(\epsilon\) whenever \(k\) {{c5::{{c4::\(\geq N\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    Example 2.5.3. Let \(0&lt;b&lt;1\). Because<br><br>\[<br>b&gt;b^{2}&gt;b^{3}&gt;b^{4}&gt;\cdots&gt;0<br>\]<br><br>the sequence \(\left(b^{n}\right)\) is decreasing and bounded below. <br><br><ul><li>The Monotone Convergence Theorem allows us to conclude that \(\left(b^{n}\right)\) converges to some \(l\) satisfying \(b&gt;l \geq 0\).&nbsp;</li><li>To compute \(l\), notice that \(\left(b^{2 n}\right)\) is a subsequence, so \(\left(b^{2 n}\right) \rightarrow\) {{c1::\(l\)}} by Theorem 2.5.2.&nbsp;</li><li>But \(b^{2 n}\)= {{c2::\(b^{n} \cdot b^{n}\)}}, so by the Algebraic Limit Theorem, \(\left(b^{2 n}\right) \rightarrow l \cdot l\) = {{c3::\(l^{2}\)}}. Because limits are unique (Theorem 2.2.7), {{c5::\(l^{2}\)}} = {{c1::\(l\)}}, and thus {{c1::\(l\)}} = {{c4::\(0\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Example 2.5.4 (Divergence Criterion). Theorem 2.5.2 is also useful for providing economical proofs for divergence. In Example 2.2.8, we were quite sure that<br><br>\[<br>\left(1,-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3},-\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \cdots\right)<br>\]<br><br>did not converge to any proposed limit. Notice that<br><br>\[<br>\left(\frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{5}, \cdots\right)<br>\]<br><br>is a subsequence that converges to \(1 / 5\). Also,<br><br>\[<br>\left(-\frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5},-\frac{1}{5}, \cdots\right)<br>\]<br><br>is a different subsequence of the original sequence that converges to \(-1 / 5\). Because we have {{c5::{{c3::two subsequences}}}} converging to {{c4::{{c1::two different limits}}}}, we can rigorously conclude that the original sequence {{c4::{{c2::diverges}}}}.

In general, we construct the closed interval \(I_{k}\) by taking a half of \(I_{k-1}\) containing an infinite number of terms of \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) and then select \(n_{k}&gt;n_{k-1}&gt;\cdots&gt;n_{2}&gt;n_{1}\) so that \(a_{n_{k}} \in I_{k}\).<br></li></ul>

Bisect the closed interval \([-M, M]\) into the two closed intervals \([-M, 0]\) and \([0, M]\). (The midpoint is included in both halves.) Now, it must be that at least one of these closed intervals contains an infinite number of the terms in the sequence \(\left(a_{n}\right)\). Select a half for which this is the case and label that interval as \(I_{1}\).

In general, we construct the closed interval \(I_{k}\) by taking a half of \(I_{k-1}\) containing an infinite number of terms of \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) and then select \(n_{k}&gt;n_{k-1}&gt;\cdots&gt;n_{2}&gt;n_{1}\) so that \(a_{n_{k}} \in I_{k}\).<br><br>We want to argue that \(\left(a_{n_{k}}\right)\) is a convergent subsequence, but we need a candidate for the limit.

    Exercise 2.5.3. (a) Prove that if an infinite series {{c2::converges}}, then the {{c1::associative}} property holds. Assume \(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+a_{5}+\cdots\) {{c2::converges}} to a {{c3::limit \(L\)}} . Show that any {{c5::regrouping of the terms}}:<br><br><ul><li>{{c4::\(\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n_{1}&nbsp; }\right)+\left(a_{n_{1}+1}+\cdots+a_{n_{2} }\right)+\left(a_{n_{2}+1}+\cdots+a_{n_{3} }\right)+\cdots\)}}</li></ul><br>leads to a series that also {{c2::converges}} to {{c3::\(L\).}}<br>

============================================================

  

    Exercise 2.5.4. The {{c3::Bolzano-Weierstrass}} Theorem is extremely important, and so is the strategy employed in the proof. To gain some more experience with this technique, assume the {{c1::Nested Interval Property}} is true and use it to provide a proof of the {{c2::Axiom of Completeness}}. To prevent the argument from being circular, assume also that {{c5::\(\left(1 / 2^{n}\right)\)}} {{c4::\(\rightarrow\) \(0\).&nbsp;}}

============================================================

  

    Exercise 2.5.5. Assume \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) is a {{c3::bounded}} sequence with the property that every {{c3::convergent}} {{c4::subsequence}} of \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) {{c5::{{c1::converges}}}} to {{c5::{{c2::the same limit \(a \in \mathbf{R}\)}}}}. Show that \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) must {{c5::{{c1::converge}}}} to {{c5::{{c2::\(a\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    Exercise 2.5.7. Extend the result proved in Example 2.5.3 to the case \(|b|&lt;1\); that is, {{c5::{{c2::\(\operatorname{show} \lim \left(b^{n}\right)\)}}}} = {{c4::{{c1::\(0\)}}}} if and only if {{c4::{{c3::\(-1&lt;b&lt;1\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    Exercise 2.5.8. Another way to prove the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem is to show that every sequence contains a {{c5::{{c1::monotone}}}} subsequence. A useful device in this endeavor is the notion of a {{c4::{{c2::peak term}}}}. Given a sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\), a particular term \(x_{m}\) is a {{c2::peak term}} if {{c4::{{c3::no later term in the sequence exceeds}}}} it; i.e., if \(x_{m} \) {{c4::{{c3::\(\geq x_{n}\)}}}} for all \(n \geq m\).

============================================================

  

    Exercise 2.5.9. Let \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) be a {{c3::bounded}} sequence, and define the set<br><ul><li>\(S\) = {{c2::\(\left\{x \in \mathbf{R}: x&lt;a_{n} \text { for infinitely many terms } a_{n}\right\} .\)}}</li></ul><br>Show that there exists a {{c5::{{c4::subsequence}}}} \(\left(a_{n_{k}}\right.\) ) converging to \(s\) = {{c5::{{c1::\(\sup S\)}}}}. (This is a direct proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem using the {{c5::{{c4::Axiom of Completeness}}}}.)<br>

============================================================

  

    Definition 2.6.1. A sequence \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) is called a {{c1::Cauchy}} sequence if, for every {{c3::\(\epsilon\)}} {{c4::\(&gt;0\)}}, there exists an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that whenever \(m, n\) {{c5::\(\geq N\)}} it follows that {{c2::\(\left|a_{n}-a_{m}\right|\)}} {{c4::\(&lt;\)}} {{c3::\(\epsilon\).}}

============================================================

  

    Asequence is a {{c5::{{c3::Cauchy}}}} sequence if, for {{c4::{{c2::every \(\epsilon\)}}}}, there is a point in the sequence after which the terms are {{c4::{{c1::all closer to each other}}}} than {{c4::{{c2::the given \(\epsilon\)}}}}. <br>

============================================================

  

    To spoil the surprise, we will argue in this section that in fact these two definitions are equivalent: {{c5::{{c1::Convergent}}}} sequences are {{c4::{{c2::Cauchy}}}} sequences, and {{c2::Cauchy}} sequences {{c5::{{c1::converge}}}}. The significance of the definition of a {{c2::Cauchy}} sequence is that there is {{c4::{{c3::no mention of a limit}}}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Lemma 2.6.3. Cauchy sequences are bounded.<br><br>Proof. Given \(\epsilon\) = {{c1::\(1\)}}, there exists an \(N\) such that {{c2::\(\left|x_{m}-x_{n}\right|\)}} &lt; {{c1::\(1\)}} for all \(m, n \geq N\). Thus, we must have {{c4::\(\left|x_{n}\right|\)}} \(&lt;\) {{c5::\(\left|x_{N}\right|+1\)}} for all \(n \geq N\). It follows that<br><ul><li>\(M\) = {{c3::\(\max \left\{\left|x_{1}\right|,\left|x_{2}\right|,\left|x_{3}\right|, \ldots,\left|x_{N-1}\right|,\left|x_{N}\right|+1\right\}\)}}</li></ul><br>is a bound for the sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\).<br>

============================================================

  

    Exercise 2.6.7. Exercises 2.4.4 and 2.5.4 establish the equivalence of the {{c1::Axiom of Completeness}} and the {{c2::Monotone Convergence}} Theorem. They also show the {{c5::{{c3::Nested Interval}}}} Property is equivalent to these other two in the presence of the {{c5::{{c4::Archimedean}}}} Property.

    Theorem 2.7.1 ({{c4::Algebraic Limit}} Theorem for {{c3::Series}}). If \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\) = \(A\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_{k}\) = \(B\), then<br><br><ul><li>(i) {{c3::\(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\)}} {{c5::{{c2::\(c a_{k}\)}}}} = {{c5::{{c1::\(c A\)}}}} for all \(c \in \mathbf{R}\) and</li><li>(ii) {{c3::\(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\)}} {{c5::{{c1::\(\left(a_{k}+b_{k}\right)\)}}}} = {{c5::{{c2::\(A+B\).}}}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.7.1 (Algebraic Limit Theorem for Series). If \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}=A\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_{k}=B\), then<br><br>(i) \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c a_{k}=c A\) for all \(c \in \mathbf{R}\) and<br><br>(ii) \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{k}+b_{k}\right)=A+B\).<br><br>Proof. (i) In order to show that \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c a_{k}=c A\), we must argue that the sequence of partial sums<br><br>\[<br>t_{m}=c a_{1}+c a_{2}+c a_{3}+\cdots+c a_{m}<br>\]<br><br>converges to \(c A\). But we are given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\) converges to \(A\), meaning that the partial sums<br><br>\[<br>s_{m}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+\cdots+a_{m}<br>\]<br><br>converge to \(A\). Because \(t_{m}\) = {{c5::{{c1::\(c s_{m}\)}}}}, applying the {{c4::{{c2::Algebraic Limit}}}} Theorem for {{c4::{{c3::sequences}}}}&nbsp; yields \(\left(t_{m}\right) \rightarrow c A\), as desired.

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.7.2 ({{c4::Cauchy Criterion}} for Series). The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\) converges if and only if, given {{c2::\(\epsilon\)}} {{c5::{{c3::\(&gt;0\)}}}}, there exists an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that whenever \(n&gt;m\) {{c4::\(\geq N\)}} it follows that<br><br><ul><li>{{c5::{{c1::\(\left|a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\cdots+a_{n}\right|\)}}}} {{c5::{{c3::&lt;}}}} {{c2::\(\epsilon\)}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.7.3. If the {{c4::series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\)}} {{c3::\(a_{k}\)}} {{c5::{{c2::converges}}}}, then \(\left(a_{k}\right)\) \(\rightarrow\) {{c5::{{c1::\(0\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;Theorem 2.7.4 ({{c3::Comparison}} Test). Assume \(\left(a_{k}\right)\) and \(\left(b_{k}\right)\) are sequences satisfying {{c4::\(0\)}} {{c3::\(\leq\)}} {{c4::\(a_{k}\)}} {{c3::\(\leq\)}} {{c5::\(b_{k}\)}} for all \(k \in \mathbf{N}\).<br><br><ul><li>(i) If {{c3::\(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(b_{k}\) {{c1::converges}}, then {{c3::\(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(a_{k}\) {{c1::converges}}.</li><li>(ii) If {{c3::\(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(a_{k}\) {{c2::diverges}}, then {{c3::\(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(b_{k}\) {{c2::diverges}}.</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.7.4 (Comparison Test). Assume \(\left(a_{k}\right)\) and \(\left(b_{k}\right)\) are sequences satisfying \(0 \leq a_{k} \leq b_{k}\) for all \(k \in \mathbf{N}\).<br><br><ul><li>(i) If \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_{k}\) converges, then \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\) converges.</li><li>(ii) If \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\) diverges, then \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_{k}\) diverges.</li></ul>Proof. Both statements follow immediately from the {{c1::Cauchy Criterion for Series}} and the observation that<br><br><ul><li>{{c3::\(\left|a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\cdots+a_{n}\right| \)}} {{c5::{{c4::\(\leq\)}}}} {{c5::{{c2::\(\left|b_{m+1}+b_{m+2}+\cdots+b_{n}\right| .\)}}}}</li></ul><br>

============================================================

  

    This is a good point to remind ourselves again that statements about convergence of sequences and series are immune to changes in some finite number of initial terms. In the Comparison Test, the requirement that \(0 \leq a_{k} \leq b_{k}\) does not really need to hold for all \(k \in \mathbf{N}\) but just needs to be eventually true. A {{c1::weaker}}, but {{c2::sufficient}}, hypothesis would be to assume that there exists {{c3::some point \(M \in \mathbf{N}\)}} such that {{c4::the inequality \(a_{k} \leq b_{k}\)}} is true for {{c5::all \(k \geq M\).}}

============================================================

  

    Example 2.7.5 (Geometric Series). A series is called geometric if it is of the form<br><br><ul><li>\(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a r^{k}\) = {{c5::\(a+a r+a r^{2}+a r^{3}+\cdots\)}}</li></ul>If \(r=1\) and \(a \neq 0\), the series evidently diverges. For \(r \neq 1\), the algebraic identity<br><ul><li>{{c5::\((1-r)\left(1+r+r^{2}+r^{3}+\cdots+r^{m-1}\right)\)}} = {{c4::\(1-r^{m}\)}}</li></ul><br>enables us to rewrite the partial sum<br><br><ul><li>\(s_{m}\) = \(a+a r+a r^{2}+a r^{3}+\cdots+a r^{m-1}\) = {{c4::\(\frac{a\left(1-r^{m}\right)}{1-r} .\)}}</li></ul>Then<br><ul><li>\(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a r^{k}\) = {{c1::\(\frac{a}{1-r}\)}}</li></ul><br>if and only if {{c3::\(|r|\)}} {{c2::&lt; \(1\).}}<br>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.7.6 ({{c3::Absolute Convergence}} Test). If the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\){{c1::\(\left|a_{n}\right|\)}} {{c5::{{c4::converges}}}}, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\) {{c5::{{c2::\(a_{n}\)}}}} {{c4::converges}} as well.

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.7.6 (Absolute Convergence Test). If the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|\) converges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}\) converges as well.<br><br>Proof. This proof makes use of both the necessity (the "if" direction) and the sufficiency (the "only if" direction) of the Cauchy Criterion for Series. Because \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|\) converges, we know that, given an \(\epsilon&gt;0\), there exists an \(N \in \mathbf{N}\) such that<br><br><ul><li>{{c1::\(\left|a_{m+1}\right|+\left|a_{m+2}\right|+\cdots+\left|a_{n}\right|\)}} &lt; \(\epsilon\)</li></ul><br>for all \(n&gt;m \geq N\). By the {{c3::triangle}} inequality,<br><br><ul><li>{{c5::{{c2::\(\left|a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\cdots+a_{n}\right| \)}}}} \(\leq\) {{c1::\(\left|a_{m+1}\right|+\left|a_{m+2}\right|+\cdots+\left|a_{n}\right|,\)}}</li></ul><br>so the sufficiency of the {{c5::{{c4::Cauchy}}}} Criterion guarantees that \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}\) also converges.<br>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 2.7.7 (Alternating Series Test). Let \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) be a sequence satisfying,<br><br><ul><li>(i) {{c3::\(a_{1}\) \(\geq\) \(a_{2}\) \(\geq a_{3}\) \(\geq\) \(\cdots\) \(\geq\) \(a_{n}\) \(\geq\) \(a_{n+1}\) \(\geq\) \(\cdots\)}} and</li><li>(ii) {{c5::\(\left(a_{n}\right)\)}} \(\rightarrow\) {{c4::\(0\)}}.</li></ul><br>Then, the {{c1::alternating}} series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\) {{c1::\((-1)^{n+1} a_{n}\)}} {{c2::converges}}.<br>

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition</b> 2.7.8. If \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\) {{c1::\(\left|a_{n}\right|\)}} {{c4::converges}}, then we say that the {{c5::original series}} \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\) {{c2::\(a_{n}\)}} {{c4::converges}} {{c3::absolutely}}. If, on the other hand, the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\) {{c2::\( a_{n}\)}} {{c4::converges}} but the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\) {{c1::\(\left|a_{n}\right|\)}} does not {{c4::converge}}, then we say that the {{c5::original series}} \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\) {{c2::\(a_{n}\)}} {{c4::converges}} {{c3::conditionally}}.

============================================================

  

    Any {{c4::convergent}} series with ({{c3::all but finitely many}}) {{c5::{{c2::positive}}}} terms must {{c4::converge}} {{c5::{{c1::absolutely}}}}.

============================================================

  

    Informally speaking, a {{c2::rearrangement}} of a series is obtained by {{c1::permuting the terms}} in the sum into {{c2::some other order}}. It is important that {{c3::all of the original terms}} {{c4::eventually appear}} in the new ordering and that {{c5::no term gets repeated.}}

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition</b> 2.7.9. Let \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\) \(a_{k}\) be a series. A series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\) \(b_{k}\) is called a {{c2::rearrangement}} of \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\) \(a_{k}\) if there exists a {{c3::one-to-one}}, {{c4::onto}} function \(f:\) {{c5::\(\mathbf{N}\)}} \(\rightarrow \) {{c5::\(\mathbf{N}\)}} such that {{c2::\(b_{f(k)}\)}} = {{c1::\(a_{k}\)}} for all \(k \in \mathbf{N}\).

    Theorem 2.7.10. If a series converges absolutely, then any rearrangement of this series converges to the same limit.<br><br>Proof. Assume \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\) converges absolutely to \(A\), and let \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_{k}\) be a rearrangement of \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{k}\).

    Given a doubly indexed array of real numbers \(\left\{a_{i j}: i, j \in \mathbf{N}\right\}\), we discovered in Section 2.1 that there is a dangerous ambiguity in how we might define {{c4::\(\sum_{i, j=1}^{\infty} a_{i j}\)}}. Performing the sum over {{c2::first one of the variables}} and {{c5::{{c3::then the other}}}} is referred to as an {{c5::{{c1::iterated}}}} summation.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Performing the sum over first one of the variables and then the other is referred to as an iterated summation. In our specific example, summing the {{c3::rows first}} and then {{c4::taking the sum of these totals}} produced a different result than {{c5::first computing the sum of each column}} and {{c5::adding these sums together}}. In short,<br><br><ul><li>{{c1::\(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(a_{i j}\) \(\neq\) {{c2::\(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(a_{i j}\)</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    There are still other ways to reasonably define \(\sum_{i, j=1}^{\infty} a_{i j}\). One natural idea is to calculate a kind of {{c4::partial sum}} by {{c4::adding together finite numbers of terms}} in {{c3::larger and larger "rectangles"}} in the array; that is, for \(m, n \in \mathbf{N}\), set<br><ul><li>{{c5::{{c2::\(s_{m n}\)}}}} = {{c5::{{c1::\(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\)}}}} \(a_{i j} \)</li></ul>

If the sequence {{c3::\(\left(s_{n n}\right)\)}} converges, for instance, we might wish to define<br><br><ul><li>{{c3::\(\sum_{i, j=1}^{\infty} a_{i j}\)}} = {{c2::\(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\)}} {{c1::\(s_{n n}\)}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    There is a deep similarity between the issue of how to define a {{c1::double}} summation and the topic of {{c2::rearrangements}}. Both relate to the {{c5::{{c3::commutativity}}}} of {{c5::{{c3::addition}}}} in an infinite setting. For {{c2::rearrangements}}, the resolution came with the added hypothesis of {{c5::{{c4::absolute convergence}}}}, and it is not surprising that the same remedy applies for {{c1::double}} summations.

============================================================

  

    Under the assumption of {{c5::absolute convergence}} taking the limit {{c1::over rows}} then {{c2::column}}, {{c2::columns}} then {{c1::rows}} or over {{c3::squares}} gives the {{c4::same result}} for {{c5::double}} summation

    Conspicuously missing from the Algebraic Limit Theorem for Series (Theorem 2.7.1) is any statement about the product of two convergent series. One way to formally carry out the algebra on such a product is to write<br><br><ul><li>\(\left(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} b_j\right)\) =<br></li><li>={{c5::&nbsp;\(\left(a_1+a_2+a_3+\cdots\right)\left(b_1+b_2+b_3+\cdots\right)\)}}</li><li>={{c5::&nbsp;\(a_1 b_1+\left(a_1 b_2+a_2 b_1\right)+\left(a_3 b_1+a_2 b_2+a_1 b_3\right)+\cdots\)}}</li><li>= {{c4::\(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\)}} {{c3::\(d_k\)}}</li></ul>where<br><ul><li>\(d_{k}\)= {{c3::\(\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\)}} {{c2::\(a_i b_{k-i}\)}}</li></ul><br>This particular form of the product, examined earlier in Exercise 2.8.6, is called the {{c1::Cauchy}} product of two series.&nbsp;<br>

============================================================

  

    Exercise 2.8.7. Assume that \(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} a_{i}\) converges {{c4::absolutely}} to \(A\), and \(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} b_{j}\) converges {{c4::absolutely}} to \(B\).<br><br><br>(a) Show that the iterated sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\) {{c4::\(\left|a_{i} b_{j}\right|\)}} converges so that we may apply Theorem 2.8.1.<br><br>(b) Let \(s_{n n}\) ={{c3::\(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\) \(\sum_{j=1}^{n}\)}} \(a_{i} b_{j}\), and prove that \(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} s_{n n}\) = {{c5::{{c1::\(A B\)}}}}. Conclude that<br><br><ul><li>{{c3::\(\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(a_{i} b_{j}\)&nbsp;</li><li>= {{c3::\(\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\)}} \(a_{i} b_{j} \)</li><li>= \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}\) {{c5::{{c2::\(d_{k}\)&nbsp;}}}}</li><li>= {{c1::\(A B\)}}</li></ul><br>where, as before, {{c5::{{c2::\(d_{k}\)}}}} = \(a_{1} b_{k-1}+a_{2} b_{k-2}+\cdots+a_{k-1} b_{1}\).<br>

============================================================

  

    In the case of {{c5::{{c3::rearrangements}}}}, not only are {{c4::{{c1::conditionally}}}} convergent series no longer guaranteed to converge to the same limit, but in fact if \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}\) converges {{c1::conditionally}}, then for {{c4::{{c2::any \(r \in \mathbf{R}\)}}}} there exists {{c5::{{c3::a rearrangement}}}} of {{c5::{{c3::\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}\)}}}} that {{c4::{{c2::converges to \(r\)}}}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    For conditionally convergent series we can rearange them to converge to any desired limit. To see why, let's look again at the alternating harmonic series<br><br>\[<br>\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6}+\cdots<br>\]<br><br>The negative terms taken alone form the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1) / 2 n\). The partial sums of this series are precisely {{c1::\(-1 / 2\)}} times the partial sums of {{c1::the harmonic series}}, and so march off to {{c2::negative infinity}}. A similar argument shows that the sum of positive terms \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1 /(2 n-1)\) also {{c2::diverges to infinity}}. It is not too difficult to argue that this situation is {{c3::always the case}} for {{c3::conditionally}} convergent series. Now, let \(r\) be some proposed limit, which, for the sake of this argument, we take to be positive. The idea is to take as many positive terms as necessary to form the first partial sum {{c4::greater than \(r\)}}. We then add {{c4::negative terms}} until the partial sum {{c5::falls below \(r\)}}, at which point we {{c5::switch back}} to {{c4::positive terms}}. The fact that there is no {{c5::bound}} on the sums of either the positive terms or the negative terms allows this process to {{c5::continue indefinitely}}. The fact that the terms themselves {{c5::tend to zero}} is enough to guarantee that the partial sums, when constructed in this manner, indeed converge to \(r\) as they {{c5::oscillate around}} this target value.

============================================================

  

    Perhaps the best way to summarize the situation is to say that the hypothesis of {{c1::absolute}} {{c2::convergence}} essentially allows us to treat {{c5::{{c3::infinite}}}} sums as though they were {{c5::{{c3::finite}}}} sums. This assessment extends to {{c5::{{c4::double}}}} sums as well

============================================================

  

    We showed in Exercise 2.8.7 that the Cauchy product of two {{c1::absolutely}} convergent infinite series converges to the product of the two factors, but in fact the same conclusion follows if we only have {{c1::absolute}} convergence in {{c2::one of the two}} {{c3::original series}}. In the notation of Exercise 2.8.7, if \(\sum a_{n}\) converges {{c1::absolutely}} to \(A\), and if \(\sum b_{n}\) {{c4::converges}}&nbsp; to \(B\), then the Cauchy product \(\sum d_{k}\) = {{c5::\(A B\).}}

============================================================

  

    If both \(\sum a_{n}\) and \(\sum b_{n}\) {{c1::converge}} {{c2::conditionally}}, then it is possible for the {{c5::{{c3::Cauchy product}}}} to {{c5::{{c4::diverge}}}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Of course, it is also possible to find \(\sum a_{n}\) = \(A\) {{c1::conditionally}} and \(\sum b_{n}\) = \(B\) {{c1::conditionally}} whose {{c2::Cauchy product}} {{c4::\(\sum d_{k}\)}} {{c3::converges}}. If this is the case, then the {{c3::convergence}} is {{c5::to the right value}}, namely \(\sum d_{k}\) = {{c5::\(A B\).}}

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;A power series has the form \(a_{0}+a_{1} x+a_{2} x^{2}+\cdots\).

    The cantor set:<br>\[<br>C=[0,1] \backslash\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \cup\left(\frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}\right) \cup\left(\frac{7}{9}, \frac{8}{9}\right) \cup \cdots\right] .<br>\]<br><br>To this point, the information we have collected suggests a mental picture of \(C\) as a {{c4::relatively small}}, {{c4::thin}} set. For these reasons, the set \(C\) is often referred to as Cantor "{{c5::dust}}." But there are some strong counterarguments that imply a very different picture. However, \(C\) is actually {{c1::uncountable}}, with {{c2::cardinality}} equal to the {{c2::cardinality}} of {{c3::\(\mathbf{R}\).}}

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;First, \(C\) is actually uncountable, with cardinality equal to the cardinality of \(\mathbf{R}\). One slightly intuitive but convincing way to see this is to create a 1-1 correspondence between \(C\) and sequences of the form \(\left(a_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\), where \(a_{n}\) = ({{c1::\(0\)}} or {{c2::1}}) . For each \(c \in C\), set \(a_{1}\) = {{c1::\(0\)}} if \(c\) {{c2::falls in the left-hand component}} of \(C_{1}\) and set \(a_{1}\) = {{c2::\(1\)}} if \(c\) {{c1::falls in the right-hand component}}. Having established where in \(C_{1}\) the point \(c\) is located, there are now two possible components of \(C_{2}\) that might contain \(c\). This time, we set \(a_{2}\) = {{c1::\(0\)}} or {{c2::1}} depending on whether \(c\) {{c3::falls in the left or right half}} of {{c3::these two components of \(C_{2}\)}}. Continuing in this way, we come to see that every element \(c \in C\) yields a sequence \(\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots\right)\) of zeros and ones that acts as a {{c4::set of directions}} for {{c5::how to locate \(c\) within \(C\)}}. Likewise, every such sequence corresponds to a point in the Cantor set. Because the set of sequences of zeros and ones is {{c5::uncountable}} (Exercise 1.6.4), we must conclude that \(C\) is uncountable as well.

============================================================

  

    It may be useful to understand \(C\) as the remainder of the interval \([0,1]\) after the iterative process of removing open middle thirds is taken to infinity:<br><br>\[<br>C=[0,1] \backslash\left[\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \cup\left(\frac{1}{9}, \frac{2}{9}\right) \cup\left(\frac{7}{9}, \frac{8}{9}\right) \cup \cdots\right] .<br>\]<br><br>Since C is uncountable, Because the endpoints of the approximating sets \(C_{n}\) form a countable set, we are forced to accept the fact that not only are there other points in \(C\) but there are {{c1::uncountably}} many of them. From the point of view of cardinality, \(C\) is quite large - as large as \(\mathbf{R}\), in fact. This should be contrasted with the fact that from the point of view of {{c3::length}}, \(C\) measures the same {{c3::size}} as {{c2::a single point.}} We conclude this discussion with a demonstration that from the point of view of {{c4::dimension}}, \(C\) strangely falls {{c5::somewhere in between.}}

============================================================

  

    There is a sensible agreement that a point has dimension {{c1::zero}}, a line segment has dimension {{c2::one}}, a square has dimension {{c5::{{c3::two}}}}, and a cube has dimension {{c5::{{c4::three}}}}.

============================================================

  

    Figure for how dimension scales {{c1::<img src="paste-222facd24194435311c47162962aa103902fa788.jpg" style="width: 816.007px;">}}<br><br>Without attempting a formal definition of dimension (of which there are several), we can nevertheless get a sense of how one might be defined by observing how the dimension affects the result of magnifying each particular set by a factor of 3 (Fig. 3.2). A single point undergoes {{c3::no change at all}}, whereas a line segment {{c2::triples in length}}. For the square, magnifying each length by a factor of 3 results in a larger square that contains {{c4::9 copies of the original square}}. Finally, the magnified cube yields a cube that contains {{c5::27 copies of the original cube}} within its {{c5::volume}}. Notice that, in each case, to compute the "{{c5::size}}" of the new set, the {{c4::dimension}} appears as the {{c5::exponent}} of the magnification factor.

============================================================

  

    Now, apply this transformation to the Cantor set. The set \(C_{0}\) = \([0,1]\) becomes the interval \([0,3]\). Deleting the middle third leaves \([0,1] \cup[2,3]\), which is where we started in the original construction except that we now stand to produce an {{c1::additional copy of \(C\) in the interval [2,3]}}. Magnifying the Cantor set by a factor of {{c3::3}} yields {{c2::two copies of the original set}}. Thus, if \(x\) is the dimension of \(C\), then \(x\) should satisfy {{c5::\(2\)}} = {{c4::\(3^{x}\)}}, or {{c4::\(x\)}} = {{c5::\(\log 2 / \log 3 \approx .631\)}} (Fig. 3.3).

============================================================

  

    The notion of a {{c1::noninteger}} or {{c2::fractional}} dimension is the impetus behind the term "{{c2::fractal}}," coined in 1975 by Benoit Mandlebrot to describe a class of sets whose intricate structures have much in common with the {{c3::Cantor}} set. Cantor's construction, however, is over a hundred years old and for us represents an invaluable testing ground for the upcoming theorems and conjectures about the often elusive nature of {{c4::subsets}} of {{c5::the real line.}}

============================================================

  

    Given \(a \in \mathbf{R}\) and \(\epsilon&gt;0\), recall that the \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of \(a\) is the set<br><br><ul><li>{{c2::\(V_{\epsilon}(a)\)}} = {{c1::\(\{x \in \mathbf{R}:|x-a|&lt;\epsilon\} .\)}}</li></ul><br>In other words, {{c2::\(V_{\epsilon}(a)\)}} is the {{c4::open interval}} {{c3::\((a-\epsilon, a+\epsilon)\)}}, {{c5::centered at \(a\)}} with {{c5::radius \(\epsilon\).}}<br>

============================================================

  

    <b>Definition</b> 3.2.1. A set \(O\) \(\subseteq\)&nbsp; \(\mathbf{R}\) is {{c2::open}} if for {{c3::all points \(a \in O\)}} there {{c3::exists}} an {{c4::\(\epsilon\)-neighborhood}} {{c1::\(V_{\epsilon}(a)\)}} {{c5::\(\subseteq\) \(O\).}}

============================================================

  

    Example 3.2.2. (i) Perhaps the simplest example of an {{c1::open}} set is \(\mathbf{R}\) itself. Given an arbitrary element \(a \in \mathbf{R}\), we are free to pick any {{c2::\(\epsilon\)-neighborhood}} we like and it will always be true that \(V_{\epsilon}(a)\)&nbsp; {{c5::{{c3::\(\subseteq \mathbf{R}\)}}}}. It is also the case that the logical structure of Definition 3.2.1 requires us to classify the {{c5::{{c4::empty set \(\emptyset\)}}}} as an {{c1::open}} subset of the real line.

============================================================

  

    (ii) For a more useful collection of examples, consider the open interval<br><br>\[<br>(c, d)=\{x \in \mathbf{R}: c&lt;x&lt;d\} .<br>\]<br><br>To see that \((c, d)\) is an {{c4::open}} set in the sense just defined, let \(x \in(c, d)\) be arbitrary. If we take \(\epsilon\) = {{c1::\(\min \{x-c, d-x\}\)}}, then it follows that \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) {{c5::{{c2::\(\subseteq(c, d)\)}}}}. It is important to see where this argument breaks down if the interval includes {{c5::{{c3::either one of its endpoints.}}}}

============================================================

  

    {{c3::Limit}} points are also often referred to as "{{c1::cluster}} points" or "{{c5::{{c2::accumulation}}}} points," but the phrase " \(x\) is a {{c3::limit}} point of \(A\) " has the advantage of explicitly reminding us that \(x\) is quite literally the {{c5::{{c4::limit of a sequence in \(A\).}}}}

In order to produce a sequence \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) converging to \(x\), we are going to consider the particular \(\epsilon\)-neighborhoods obtained using \(\epsilon\) = {{c1::\(1 / n\)}}.

    Theorem 3.2.5. \(A\) point \(x\) is a {{c4::limit}} point of a set \(A\) if and only if \(x=\lim a_{n}\) for some sequence \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) contained in \(A\) satisfying \(a_{n} \neq x\) for all \(n \in \mathbf{N}\).<br><br>The restriction that \(a_{n} \neq x\) in Theorem 3.2.5 deserves a comment. Given a point \(a \in A\), it is {{c1::always the case}} that \(a\) is {{c2::the limit of a sequence in \(A\)}} if we are allowed to consider the {{c3::constant}} sequence {{c3::\((a, a, a, \ldots)\)}}. There will be occasions where we will want to avoid this somewhat uninteresting situation, so it is important to have a vocabulary that can distinguish {{c4::limit}} points of a set from {{c5::isolated}} points.

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;Whereas an {{c1::isolated}} point is {{c4::always an element of the relevant set \(A\)}}, it is quite possible for a {{c2::limit}} point of \(A\) {{c5::not to belong to \(A\)}}. As an example, consider the {{c3::endpoint}} of {{c3::an open interval}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    The adjective "closed" appears in several other mathematical contexts and is usually employed to mean that an operation on the elements of a given set does not take us out of the set. In linear algebra, for example, a vector space is a set that is "closed" under addition and scalar multiplication. In analysis, the operation we are concerned with is the {{c1::limiting}} operation. Topologically speaking, a closed set is one where {{c2::convergent sequences}} within the set have {{c5::{{c3::limits}}}} that are {{c5::{{c4::also in the set.}}}}

============================================================

  

    Theorem 3.2.8. \(A\) set \(F \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is {{c1::closed}} if and only if {{c2::every Cauchy sequence contained in \(F\)}} has {{c5::{{c4::a limit}}}} that is {{c5::{{c3::also an element of \(F\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    Example 3.2.9. (i) Consider<br><br>\[<br>A=\left\{\frac{1}{n}: n \in \mathbf{N}\right\}<br>\]<br><br>Let's show that each point of \(A\) is {{c1::isolated}}.

Then,<br><br><ul><li>{{c4::\(V_{\epsilon}(1 / n) \cap A\)}} = {{c3::\(\left\{\frac{1}{n}\right\}\)}}</li></ul><br>It follows from Definition 3.2.4 that \(1 / n\) is not a {{c1::limit}} point and so is {{c1::isolated}}. Although all of the points of \(A\) are {{c5::isolated}}, the set does have&nbsp;<br>one {{c5::limit}} point, namely {{c5::0}} . This is because every neighborhood centered at {{c5::zero}}, no matter how small, is going to contain points of \(A\). Because {{c5::\(0\)}} \(\notin A, A\) is not {{c5::closed}}. The set \(F\) = {{c5::\(A \cup\{0\}\)}} is an example of a {{c5::closed}} set and is called the {{c5::closure}} of \(A\)<br><br>

============================================================

  

    (ii) Let's prove that a closed interval<br><br>\[<br>[c, d]=\{x \in \mathbf{R}: c \leq x \leq d\}<br>\]<br><br>is a closed set using Definition 3.2.7. If \(x\) is a limit point of \([c, d]\), then by Theorem 3.2.5 there exists {{c1::\(\left(x_{n}\right)\)}} {{c2::\(\subseteq[c, d]\)}} with {{c1::\(\left(x_{n}\right) \rightarrow x\)}}. We need to prove that {{c2::\(x \in[c, d]\)}}.<br><br>The key to this argument is contained in the {{c3::Order Limit}} Theorem (Theorem 2.3.4), which summarizes the relationship between {{c3::inequalities}} and the {{c3::limiting process}}. Because {{c2::\(c\)}} {{c3::\(\leq\)}} {{c1::\(x_{n}\)}} {{c3::\(\leq\)}} {{c2::\(d\)}}, it follows from Theorem 2.3.4 (iii) that {{c4::\(c\)}} {{c3::\(\leq\)}} {{c5::\(x\)}} {{c3::\(\leq\)}} {{c2::\(d\)}}.<div>Thus, \([c, d]\) is closed.</div>

============================================================

  

    (iii) Consider the set \(\mathbf{Q} \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) of rational numbers. An extremely important property of \(\mathbf{Q}\) is that its set of {{c1::limit}} points is actually {{c2::all of \(\mathbf{R}\)}}. To see why this is so, recall Theorem 1.4.3 from Chapter 1, which is referred to as the {{c3::density}} property of \(\mathbf{Q}\) in {{c2::\(\mathbf{R}\).}}<br><br>Let \(y \in \mathbf{R}\) be arbitrary, and consider any neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(y)\) = {{c4::\((y-\epsilon\), \(y+\epsilon)\)}}. Theorem 1.4.3 allows us to conclude that there exists a {{c5::rational number \(r \neq y\)}} that {{c5::falls in this neighborhood.}} Thus, \(y\) is a limit point of \(\mathbf{Q}\).

============================================================

  

    Theorem 3.2.10 ({{c4::Density}} of {{c1::\(\mathbf{Q}\)}} in {{c5::{{c3::\(\mathbf{R}\)}}}} ). For {{c5::{{c2::every}}}} \(y\) {{c5::{{c3::\(\in \mathbf{R}\)}}}}, there exists a sequence of {{c1::rational numbers}} that {{c5::{{c2::converges to \(y\)}}}}.

    Theorem 3.2.10 (Density of \(\mathbf{Q}\) in \(\mathbf{R}\) ). For every \(y \in \mathbf{R}\), there exists a sequence of rational numbers that converges to \(y\).<br><br>Proof. Combine the preceding discussion with Theorem 3.2.5.<br><br>The same argument can also be used to show that every real number is the limit of a sequence of {{c5::{{c1::irrational}}}} numbers. Although interesting, part of the allure of the rational numbers is that, in addition to being {{c4::{{c3::dense in \(\mathbf{R}\)}}}}, they are {{c4::{{c2::countable}}}}. As we will see, this tangible aspect of \(\mathbf{Q}\) makes it an extremely useful set, both for proving theorems and for producing interesting counterexamples.

The closure of \(A\) is defined to be \(\bar{A}=A \cup L\).<br><br>In Example 3.2.9 (i), we saw that if \(A\) = \(\{1 / n: n \in \mathbf{N}\}\), then the closure of \(A\) is \(\bar{A}\) = {{c1::\(A \cup\{0\}\)}}. Example 3.2 .9 (iii) verifies that {{c2::\(\overline{\mathbf{Q} }\) }} = {{c3::\(\mathbf{R}\)}}. If \(A\) is an open interval \((a, b)\), then \(\bar{A}\) = {{c4::\([a, b]\)}}.

If \(L\) is the set of {{c1::limit}} points of \(A\), then it is immediately clear that \(\bar{A}\) contains the {{c1::limit}} points of \(A\). There is still something more to prove, however, because {{c2::taking the union}} of \(L\) {{c2::with \(A\)}} could potentially produce some new {{c1::limit}} points of {{c3::\(\bar{A}\)}}. In Exercise 3.2.7, we outline the argument that this does not happen.<br><br>Now, any {{c4::closed}} set containing \(A\) must contain \(L\) as well.

Given an {{c4::open}} set \(O \subseteq \mathbf{R}\), let's first prove that \(O^{c}\) is a {{c1::closed}} set. To prove \(O^{c}\) is {{c1::closed}}, we need to show that it contains {{c2::all of its limit points}}. If \(x\) is a {{c2::limit}} point of \(O^{c}\), then every neighborhood of \(x\) contains some point of \(O^{c}\). But that is enough to conclude that \(x\) cannot be in the {{c4::open}} set \(O\) because \(x \in O\) would imply that there exists {{c5::a neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\)}} {{c3::\(\subseteq O\)}}. Thus, \(x \in O^{c}\), as desired.

Thus, given an arbitrary point \(x \in O\), we must produce an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(x) \subseteq O\). Because \(O^{c}\) is closed, we can be sure that \(x\) is {{c4::not a limit point}} of \(O^{c}\). Looking at the definition of {{c4::limit}} point, we see that this implies that there must be some neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) of \(x\) that {{c4::does not intersect}} the set {{c5::\(O^{c}\)}}. But this means \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\) {{c3::\(\subseteq O\)}}, which is precisely what we needed to show.<br><br>The second statement in Theorem 3.2.13 follows quickly from the first using the observation that {{c1::\(\left(E^{c}\right)^{c}\)}} = {{c2::\(E\)}} for any set \(E \subseteq \mathbf{R}\).

    Definition 3.3.1 ({{c2::Compactness}}). A set \(K \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is {{c2::compact}} if every sequence in \(K\) has {{c4::a subsequence}} {{c5::{{c3::that converges to a limit}}}} that is {{c5::{{c1::also in \(K\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    Example 3.3.2. The most basic example of a compact set is a {{c1::closed}} interval. To see this, notice that if \(\left(a_{n}\right)\) is contained in an interval \([c, d]\), then the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem guarantees that we can find a {{c3::convergent subsequence \(\left(a_{n_{k} }\right)\)}}. Because a {{c1::closed}} interval is a {{c1::closed}} set (Example 3.2.9, (ii)), we know that {{c5::{{c4::the limit of this subsequence}}}} is {{c5::{{c2::also in \([c, d]\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    What are the properties of closed intervals that we used in the preceding argument? The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem requires {{c1::boundedness}}, and we used the fact that {{c2::closed}} sets contain {{c5::{{c3::their limit points}}}}. As we are about to see, these two properties completely characterize {{c5::{{c4::compact}}}} sets in \(\mathbf{R}\).&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    Definition 3.3.3. A set \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is {{c1::bounded}} if {{c2::there exists \(M&gt;0\)}} such that {{c5::{{c3::\(|a|\)}}}}&nbsp; {{c5::{{c4::\(\leq\)}}}}&nbsp; {{c2::\(M\)}} for {{c5::{{c4::all \(a \in A\).}}}}

    Theorem 3.3.4 (Characterization of {{c5::{{c1::Compactness}}}} in \(\mathbf{R}\) ). \(A\) set \(K\) \(\subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is {{c5::{{c1::compact}}}} if and only if it is {{c4::{{c2::closed}}}} and {{c4::{{c3::bounded}}}}.

============================================================

  

    Theorem 3.3.4 (Characterization of Compactness in \(\mathbf{R}\) ). \(A\) set \(K \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.<br><br>Proof. Let \(K\) be compact. We will first prove that \(K\) must be bounded, so assume, for contradiction, that \(K\) is not a bounded set. The idea is to produce a sequence in \(K\) that {{c1::marches off to infinity}} in such a way that it cannot have a {{c2::convergent subsequence}} as the definition of compact requires. To do this, notice that because \(K\) is not bounded there must exist an element \(x_{1} \in K\) satisfying \(\left|x_{1}\right|\) {{c5::{{c3::\(&gt;1\)}}}}. Likewise, there must exist \(x_{2} \in K\) with \(\left|x_{2}\right|\) {{c5::{{c3::\(&gt;2\)}}}}, and in general, given any \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), we can produce \(x_{n} \in K\) such that \(\left|x_{n}\right|\) &gt; {{c5::{{c3::\(n\)}}}}.<br><br>Now, because \(K\) is assumed to be compact, \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) should have a {{c2::convergent subsequence \(\left(x_{n_{k} }\right)\)}}. But the elements of the subsequence must satisfy {{c2::\(\left|x_{n_{k} }\right|\)}} {{c5::{{c4::\(&gt;\) \(n_{k}\)}}}}, and consequently {{c2::\(\left(x_{n_{k} }\right)\)}} is {{c5::{{c4::unbounded}}}}. Because convergent sequences are bounded (Theorem 2.3.2), we have a contradiction. Thus, \(K\) must at least be a bounded set.<br>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 3.3.4 (Characterization of Compactness in \(\mathbf{R}\) ). \(A\) set \(K \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.<br><br>Proof:<br>We will show that \(K\) is closed. To see that \(K\) contains its limit points, we let \(x\) = {{c1::\(\lim x_{n}\)}}, where \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) is contained in \(K\) and argue that \(x\) {{c2::must be in \(K\) as well}}. By Definition 3.3.1, the sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) has a {{c3::convergent&nbsp;subsequence \(\left(x_{n_{k} }\right)\)}}, and by Theorem 2.5.2, we know {{c3::\(\left(x_{n_{k} }\right)\)}} {{c4::converges to the same limit \(x\)}}. Finally, Definition 3.3.1 requires that \(x\) {{c5::\(\in K\)}}. This proves that \(K\) is closed.

============================================================

  

    There may be a temptation to consider {{c5::{{c2::closed intervals}}}} as being a kind of standard archetype for {{c4::{{c1::compact}}}} sets, but this is misleading. The structure of {{c1::compact}} sets can be much more intricate and interesting. For instance, one implication of Theorem 3.3.4 is that the Cantor set is {{c1::compact}}. It is more useful to think of {{c1::compact}} sets as {{c4::{{c3::generalizations}}}} of {{c2::closed intervals}}. Whenever a fact involving {{c2::closed intervals}}&nbsp; is true, it is often the case that the same result holds when we replace "{{c5::{{c2::closed interval}}}}" with "{{c4::{{c1::compact set}}}}."

In order to take advantage of the compactness of each \(K_{n}\), we are going to produce a sequence that is {{c1::eventually}} {{c2::in each of these sets}}. Thus, for each \(n \in \mathbf{N}\), pick a point \(x_{n} \in K_{n}\). Because the compact sets are nested, it follows that the sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) is {{c3::contained in \(K_{1}\)}}. By Definition of compactness, \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) has a {{c5::convergent subsequence \(\left(x_{n_{k} }\right)\) }} for which \(x\) = {{c5::\(\lim x_{n_{k} }\)}} is {{c4::an element of \(K_{1}\)}}.

    Example 3.3.7. Consider the open interval \((0,1)\). For each point \(x \in(0,1)\), let \(O_{x}\) be the open interval {{c2::\((x / 2,1)\)}}. Taken together, the {{c4::infinite::size?}} collection {{c4::\(\left\{O_{x}: x \in(0,1)\right\}\)}} forms an {{c3::open cover}} for the open interval \((0,1)\).

    &nbsp;For \(x \in(0,1)\), the sets \(O_{x}=(x / 2,1)\) do a fine job covering \((0,1)\), but in order to have an {{c1::open cover}} of the closed interval \([0,1]\), we must also {{c2::cover the endpoints.}} To remedy this, we could fix \(\epsilon&gt;0\), and let \(O_{0}\) = {{c3::\((-\epsilon, \epsilon)\)}} and \(O_{1}\) = {{c4::\((1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\)}}.

    For \(x \in(0,1)\), the sets \(O_{x}=(x / 2,1)\) do a fine job covering \((0,1)\), but in order to have an open cover of the closed interval \([0,1]\), we must also cover the endpoints. To remedy this, we could fix \(\epsilon&gt;0\), and let \(O_{0}=(-\epsilon, \epsilon)\) and \(O_{1}=(1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)\). Then, the collection<br><br>\[<br>\left\{O_{0}, O_{1}, O_{x}: x \in(0,1)\right\}<br>\]<br><br>is an open cover for \([0,1]\). But this time, notice there is a {{c1::finite subcover}}.

    Exercise 3.3.12. Using the concept of {{c1::open covers}}, prove that every {{c2::bounded}} {{c5::{{c3::infinite}}}} set has a {{c5::{{c4::limit point.}}}}

============================================================

  

    One of the underlying goals of topology is to strip away all of the extraneous information that comes with our intuitive picture of the real numbers and isolate just those properties that are responsible for the phenomenon we are studying. For example, we were quick to observe that any closed interval is a compact set. The content of Theorem 3.3.4, however, is that the compactness of a closed interval has nothing to do with the fact that the set is an {{c1::interval}} but is a consequence of the set being {{c2::bounded}} and {{c3::closed}}. In Chapter 1, we argued that the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is an uncountable set. This turns out to be the case for any {{c4::nonempty}} {{c3::closed}} set that {{c5::does not}} contain {{c5::isolated}} points.

============================================================

  

    Definition 3.4.1. A set \(P \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is {{c1::perfect}} if it is {{c2::closed}} and contains {{c5::{{c4::no}}}} {{c5::{{c3::isolated}}}} points.

============================================================

  

    Example 3.4.2 (Cantor Set). It is not too hard to see that the Cantor set is {{c1::perfect}}. In Section 3.1, we defined the Cantor set as the intersection<br><br><ul><li>\(C=\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty} C_{n}\)</li></ul><br>where each \(C_{n}\) is a {{c3::finite}} union of {{c2::closed intervals}}. By Theorem 3.2.14, each \(C_{n}\) is {{c2::closed}}, and by the same theorem, \(C\) is {{c2::closed}} as well. It remains to show that no point in \(C\) is {{c4::isolated}}.<br><br>Let \(x \in C\) be arbitrary. To convince ourselves that \(x\) is not {{c4::isolated}}, we must construct a sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right.\) ) of points in \(C\), different from \(x\), that converges to \(x\). From our earlier discussion, we know that \(C\) at least contains the {{c5::endpoints of the intervals}} that {{c5::make up each \(C_{n}\)}}. In Exercise 3.4.3, we sketch the argument that these are all that is needed to construct \(\left(x_{n}\right)\).<br>

============================================================

  

    Theorem 3.4.3. A {{c5::{{c1::nonempty}}}} {{c4::{{c2::perfect}}}} set is {{c4::{{c3::uncountable}}}}.

============================================================

  

    Theorem 3.4.3. A nonempty perfect set is uncountable.<br><br>Proof. If \(P\) is perfect and nonempty, then it must be {{c5::{{c1::infinite}}}} because otherwise it would consist {{c4::{{c2::only of}}}} {{c4::{{c3::isolated}}}} points.

    Theorem 3.4.3. A nonempty perfect set is uncountable.<br><br>Proof. If \(P\) is perfect and nonempty, then it must be infinite because otherwise it would consist only of isolated points.

Thus, we can write<br><ul><li>\(P\)= \(\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots\right\},\)</li></ul><br>where every element of \(P\) appears on this list. The idea is to construct a sequence of {{c1::nested compact sets}} \(K_{n}\), all contained in \(P\), with the property that :<br><ul><li>{{c2::\(x_{1}\)}} {{c5::{{c4::\(\notin\)}}}} {{c5::{{c3::\(K_{2}\)}}}}, {{c2::\(x_{2}\)}} {{c4::\(\notin\)}} {{c5::{{c3::\(K_{3}\)}}}}, {{c2::\(x_{3}\)}} {{c4::\(\notin\)}} {{c5::{{c3::\(K_{4}\)}}}}, \(\ldots\).&nbsp;</li></ul><br>

Observe that \(I_{3} \cap P \neq \emptyset\) because this intersection contains at least \(y_{3}\).<br><br>If we carry out this construction inductively, the result is a sequence of closed intervals \(I_{n}\) satisfying<br><br><ul><li>(i) \(I_{n+1}\) \(\subseteq\) \(I_{n}\),</li><li>(ii) \(x_{n}\) \(\notin\) \(I_{n+1}\)</li><li>(iii) \(I_{n}\) \(\cap P\) \(\neq\) \(\emptyset\).</li></ul><br>To finish the proof, we let \(K_{n}\) = \(I_{n} \cap P\).

Hence, \(K_{n}\) is compact. <br><br>By construction, \(K_{n}\) is not empty and \(K_{n+1}\) \(\subseteq K_{n}\).

We will prove in a moment that every {{c1::interval}} is a {{c2::connected}} subset of {{c5::{{c3::\(\mathbf{R}\)}}}} and {{c5::{{c4::vice versa.}}}}

============================================================

  

    (ii) Let's show that the set of rational numbers is disconnected. If we let<br><ul><li>\(A\) = \(\mathbf{Q}\) \(\cap\) {{c1::\( (-\infty, \sqrt{2})\)&nbsp;}}</li><li>\(B\) = \(\mathbf{Q}\) \(\cap\) {{c2::\((\sqrt{2}, \infty)\)}}</li></ul><br>then we certainly have \(\mathbf{Q}\) = {{c3::\(A \cup B\)}}. The fact that \(A\) \(\subseteq\) {{c1::\((-\infty, \sqrt{2})\)}} implies (by the Order Limit Theorem) that any limit point of \(A\) will necessarily fall in {{c4::\((-\infty, \sqrt{2}]\)}}. Because this is {{c5::disjoint}} from \(B\), we get {{c5::\(\bar{A} \cap B\)}} = {{c4::\(\emptyset\).}} We can similarly show that {{c5::\(A \cap \bar{B}\)}} = {{c4::\(\emptyset\)}}, which implies that \(A\) and \(B\) are {{c5::separated}}.<br>

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;Essentially, a set \(E\) is {{c1::connected}} if, no matter how it is partitioned into two {{c5::nonempty}} {{c5::disjoint}} sets, it is always possible to show that {{c4::at least one of the sets}} contains {{c2::a limit point}} of {{c3::the other.}}

    <b>Theorem</b> 3.4.6. \(A\) set \(E\)&nbsp; \(\subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is {{c4::connected}} if and only if, for all {{c5::nonempty}} {{c5::disjoint}} sets \(A\) and \(B\) satisfying \(E\) = {{c5::\(A \cup B\)}}, there always exists a {{c1::convergent sequence}} {{c1::\(\left(x_{n}\right) \rightarrow x\)::notation}} with {{c1::\(\left(x_{n}\right)\)}} contained in {{c2::one of \(A\) or \(B\)}}, and {{c1::\(x\)}} {{c3::an element of the other.}}

============================================================

  

    The concept of {{c5::connectedness}} is more relevant when working with {{c2::subsets of the plane}} and other {{c1::higher-dimensional}} spaces. This is because, in \(\mathbf{R}\), the {{c5::connected}} sets coincide precisely with the collection of {{c3::intervals}} (with the understanding that {{c4::unbounded}}&nbsp; are included).

Theorem 3.3.5 asserts that a {{c1::nested}} {{c2::sequence}} of {{c3::compact}} sets has a {{c4::nontrivial}} {{c5::intersection}}. In this theorem, we are dealing with {{c3::dense}}, {{c3::open}} sets, but as it turns out, we are going to use Theorem 3.3.5-and actually, just the {{c5::Nested Interval}} Property - as the crucial step in the argument.

============================================================

  

    We have encountered several equivalent ways to assert that a particular set \(G\) is {{c1::dense}} in \(\mathbf{R}\). In Section 3.2, we observed that \(G\) is {{c1::dense}} in \(\mathbf{R}\) if and only if every point of \(\mathbf{R}\) is a {{c2::limit}} point of \(G\).

    Exercise 3.5.8. Show that a set \(E\) is {{c4::nowhere}}-{{c3::dense}} in \(\mathbf{R}\) if and only if {{c5::{{c1::the complement}}}} of {{c5::{{c2::\(\bar{E}\)}}}} is {{c3::dense}} in \(\mathbf{R}\).

    Theorem 3.5.4 ({{c5::Baire's}} Theorem). The set of {{c5::real}} numbers {{c5::\(\mathbf{R}\)}} {{c4::cannot be written}} as the {{c2::countable}} {{c3::union}} of {{c1::nowhere-dense}} sets.

============================================================

  

    {{c1::Baire's}} Theorem is yet another statement about the size of \(\mathbf{R}\). We have already encountered several ways to describe the sizes of infinite sets. In terms of {{c2::cardinality}}, {{c5::{{c3::countable}}}} sets are {{c5::{{c4::relatively small}}}} whereas {{c5::{{c3::uncountable}}}} sets are {{c5::{{c4::large}}}}.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    We also briefly discussed the concept of "length," or "measure," in Section 3.1. Baire's Theorem offers a third perspective. From this point of view, {{c2::nowhere-dense}} sets are considered to be "{{c1::thin}}" sets. Any set that is the {{c3::countable}} {{c4::union}} - i.e., a {{c3::not very large}} {{c4::union}} - of these small sets is called a "{{c5::meager}}" set or a set of "{{c5::first}} category." A set that is not of {{c5::first}} category is of "{{c5::second}} category." Intuitively, sets of the second category are the "{{c3::fat}}" subsets. The Baire Category Theorem, as it is often called, states that \(\mathbf{R}\) is of second category.

============================================================

  

    <ul><li>There is a significance to the Baire Category Theorem that is difficult to appreciate at the moment because we are only seeing a special case of this result.&nbsp;</li><li>The real numbers are an example of a {{c1::complete}} {{c2::metric}} space.&nbsp;</li><li>{{c2::Metric}} spaces are discussed in some detail in Section 8.2, but here is the basic idea.&nbsp;</li><li>Given a set of mathematical objects such as real numbers, points in the plane or continuous functions defined on \([0,1]\), a "{{c2::metric}}" is a rule that assigns a "{{c3::distance}}" between two elements in the set. In \(\mathbf{R}\), we have been using {{c4::\(|x-y|\)}} as the {{c3::distance}} between the real numbers \(x\) and \(y\).&nbsp;</li><li>The point is that if we can create a satisfactory notion of "{{c3::distance}}" on these other spaces (we will need the {{c5::triangle inequality}} to hold, for instance), then the concepts of convergence, Cauchy sequences, and open sets, for example, can be naturally transferred over.&nbsp;</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    A {{c3::complete}} {{c4::metric}} space is any set with a suitably defined metric in which {{c1::Cauchy sequences}} have {{c2::limits}}. We have spent a good deal of time discussing the fact that {{c5::\(\mathbf{R}\)}} is a {{c3::complete}} {{c4::metric}} space whereas {{c5::\(\mathbf{Q}\)}} is not.

============================================================

  

    The Baire Category Theorem in its more general form states that any {{c1::complete}} {{c2::metric}} space must be {{c3::too large}} to be the {{c4::countable}} {{c5::union}} of {{c4::nowhere-dense}} subsets.&nbsp;

============================================================

  

    <ul><li>One particularly interesting example of a {{c2::complete}} {{c2::metric}} space is the set of continuous functions defined on the interval \([0,1]\).&nbsp;</li><li>(The distance between two functions \(f\) and \(g\) in this space is defined to be {{c1::\(\sup |f(x)-g(x)|\)}}, where \(x \in[0,1]\).)&nbsp;</li><li>Now, in this space we will see that the collection of continuous functions that are differentiable {{c3::at even one point}} can be written as the {{c3::countable}} {{c3::union}} of {{c4::nowhere-dense}} sets.&nbsp;</li><li>Thus, a fascinating consequence of Baire's Theorem in this setting is that most continuous functions {{c5::do not have}} derivatives {{c5::at any point}}.&nbsp;</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    This odd situation mirrors the roles of \(\mathbf{Q}\) and \(\mathbf{I}\) as subsets of \(\mathbf{R}\). Just as the familiar {{c1::rational}} numbers constitute a {{c2::minute}} proportion of the real line, the {{c3::differentiable}} functions of calculus are {{c4::exceedingly atypical}} of {{c5::continuous}} functions in general.

    1. (Abbott 1.2.1(b)) Where does the proof in Theorem 1.1.1 (of the book) breakdown if we try to use it to prove \(\sqrt{4}\) is irrational.<br><br>Solution. We could start by assuming that \((p / q)^{2}=4\) where \(p, q \in \mathbb{Z}\) have no common factor. This implies that \(p^{2}=4 q^{2}\). If we proceed in the same manner of the book we would want to argue that if {{c1::4 divides \(p^{2}\)}} then {{c2::4 divides \(p\)}}, but this is not true. So the same proof does not work.<br><br>We could try to deviate from the proof just slightly. Notice that \(p^{2}=4 q^{2}=2 \cdot 2 q^{2}\) implies that \(p\) = \(2 r\) is even. Thus, \((2 r)^{2}\) = {{c5::{{c4::\(4 q^{2} \Longrightarrow r^{2}=q^{2} \Longrightarrow r= \pm q\)}}}}. We have shown that \(r\) divides \(p\) and \(r\) divides \(q\). We conclude \(r\) = {{c5::{{c3::\(1\)}}}} and therefore \(p\) = {{c5::{{c3::\(2\)}}}} and \(q\) = {{c3::\(1\)}}. Of course this is true: \((2 / 1)^{2}=4\).

    A natural question to ask is whether the theorems we have proved about sequences, series, and functions in \(\mathbf{R}\) have analogues in the plane \(\mathbf{R}^{2}\) or in even higher dimensions. Looking back over the proofs, one crucial observation is that most of the arguments depend on just a few basic properties of the {{c3::absolute value}} function. Interpreting the statement " {{c4::\(|x-y|\)}} " to mean the "{{c5::{{c1::distance}}}} from \(x\) to \(y\) in {{c5::{{c2::\(\mathbf{R}\)}}}}," our aim is to experiment with other ways of measuring {{c1::distance}} on other sets such as \(\mathbf{R}^{2}\) and \(C[0,1]\), the space of continuous functions on \([0,1]\).

============================================================

  

    Definition 8.2.1. Given a set \(X\), a function \(d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) is a metric on \(X\) if for all \(x, y \in X\) :<br><br><ul><li>(i) \(d(x, y)\)&nbsp; \(\geq\) \(0\) with \(d(x, y)\) = \(0\) if and only if \(x\) = \(y\),</li><li>(ii) {{c1::\(d(x, y)\)}} = {{c2::\(d(y, x)\)}}, and</li><li>(iii) for all \(z \in X\), {{c1::\(d(x, y)\)}} {{c5::\(\leq\)}} {{c3::\(d(x, z)\)}}{{c2::+}}{{c4::\(d(z, y)\).}}</li></ul>

============================================================

  

    A {{c5::{{c2::metric space}}}} is a {{c4::{{c3::set \(X\)}}}} together with a {{c4::{{c1::metric \(d\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    &nbsp;The next two exercises illustrate the point that the same set \(X\) can be home to {{c1::several different metrics}}. When referring to a {{c3::metric space}}, we must specify the {{c5::{{c4::set}}}} and the {{c5::{{c2::particular distance function \(d\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    (a) \(d(x, y)\) ={{c1::\(\sqrt{\left(x_{1}-y_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{2}-y_{2}\right)^{2} }\).}}<br><br>The metric in part (a) of the previous exercise is the familiar {{c3::Euclidean}} distance between two points in the plane. This is often referred to as the "{{c4::usual}}" or "{{c4::standard}}" metric on {{c5::\(\mathbf{R}^{2}\)}}. The usual metric on {{c4::\(\mathbf{R}\)}} is our old friend \(d(x, y)=\) {{c2::\(|x-y|\).}}

============================================================

  

    Definition 8.2.2. Let \((X, d)\) be a metric space. A sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right) \subseteq X\) {{c5::converges}} to an element \(x \in X\) if for all {{c2::\(\epsilon\)}} {{c4::\(&gt;0\)}} there exists an {{c3::\(N \in \mathbf{N}\)}} such that {{c1::\(d\left(x_{n}, x\right)\)}} {{c5::\(&lt;\)}} {{c2::\(\epsilon\)}} whenever {{c3::\(n\)}} {{c4::\(\geq N\).}}

============================================================

  

    Definition 8.2.3. A sequence \(\left(x_{n}\right)\) in a metric space \((X, d)\) is a {{c2::Cauchy}} sequence if for all {{c3::\(\epsilon\)}} {{c5::\(&gt;0\)}} there exists an {{c4::\(N \in \mathbf{N}\)}} such that \(d\) {{c1::\(\left(x_{m}, x_{n}\right)\)}} \(&lt;\) {{c3::\(\epsilon\)}} whenever {{c4::\(m, n\)}} {{c5::\(\geq N\).}}

============================================================

  

    The Cauchy Criterion, as it is called in \(\mathbf{R}\), was an "if and only if" statement. In the general {{c5::metric space}} setting, however, the converse statement does not always hold. Recall that, in \(\mathbf{R}\), the assertion that "Cauchy sequences converge" was shown to be equivalent to the {{c1::Axiom of Completeness}}. In order to transport the {{c1::Axiom of Completeness}} into a {{c5::metric space}}, we would need to have an {{c2::ordering}} on our space so that we could discuss such things as {{c2::upper bounds}}. It is an interesting observation that not every set can be {{c2::ordered}} in a satisfying way (the points in \(\mathbf{R}^{2}\) for example). Even without an {{c2::ordering}}, we are still going to want {{c3::completeness}}. For {{c5::metric spaces}}, the {{c4::convergence}} of {{c4::Cauchy}} sequences is taken to be the definition of {{c3::completeness}}.

============================================================

  

    Definition 8.2.4. A {{c5::metric}} space \((X, d)\) is {{c1::complete}} if every {{c3::Cauchy sequence}} in \(X\) {{c4::converges to}} {{c2::an element of \(X\).}}

    Definition 8.2.5. Let \(\left(X, d_{1}\right)\) and \(\left(Y, d_{2}\right)\) be metric spaces. A function \(f\) : \(X \rightarrow Y\) is {{c1::continuous}} at \(x \in X\) if for all {{c3::\(\epsilon\)}} \(&gt;0\) there exists a {{c4::\(\delta\)}} {{c5::\(&gt;0\)}} such that {{c2::\(d_{2}(f(x), f(y))\)}} {{c4::\(&lt;\)}} {{c3::\(\epsilon\)}} whenever {{c1::\(d_{1}(x, y)\)}} {{c3::\(&lt;\)}} {{c4::\(\delta\).}}

============================================================

  

    Definition 8.2.6. Given {{c3::\(\epsilon\)}} {{c4::\(&gt;0\)}} and an element \(x\) in the metric space \((X, d)\), the {{c3::\(\epsilon\)}}-{{c4::neighborhood}} of \(x\) is the set {{c5::{{c2::\(V_{\epsilon}(x)\)}}}} = {{c5::{{c1::\(\{y \in X: d(x, y)&lt;\epsilon\}\).}}}}

============================================================

  

    With the definition of an \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood, we can now define open sets, limit points, and closed sets exactly as we did before. A set \(O \subseteq X\) is {{c3::open}} if for every \(x \in O\) we can find a {{c1::neighborhood \(V_{\epsilon}(x)\)}} {{c2::\(\subseteq O\)}}. A point \(x\) is a {{c4::limit}} point of a set \(A\) if every {{c1::\(V_{\epsilon}(x)\)}} intersects \(A\) in some {{c5::point other than \(x\)}}. A set \(C\) is {{c5::closed}} if it contains its {{c4::limit}} points.

============================================================

  

    Definition 8.2.7. A subset \(K\) of a metric space \((X, d)\) is {{c1::compact}} if every {{c5::sequence}} in \(K\) has a {{c2::convergent}} {{c4::subsequence}} that {{c2::converges}} to a {{c5::limit}} {{c3::in \(K\).}}

============================================================

  

    An extremely useful characterization of compactness in \(\mathbf{R}\) is the proposition that a set is {{c4::compact}} if and only if it is {{c2::closed}} and {{c5::{{c3::bounded}}}}. For abstract metric spaces, this proposition only holds in the {{c5::{{c1::forward}}}} direction.

============================================================

  

    (b) Show that if \(K\) is a {{c5::{{c1::compact}}}} subset of the metric space \((X, d)\), then \(K\) is {{c4::{{c2::closed}}}} and {{c4::{{c3::bounded}}}}.

============================================================

  

    It is possible for a {{c1::closed}} and {{c2::bounded}} subset of an {{c5::{{c4::abstract metric space}}}} not to be {{c5::{{c3::compact}}}}

============================================================

  

    Exercise 8.2.13. If \(E\) is a subset of a metric space \((X, d)\), show that {{c4::\(E\)}} is {{c3::nowhere-dense}} in \(X\) if and only if {{c5::{{c1::\(\bar{E}^{c}\)}}}} is {{c5::{{c2::dense}}}} in \(X\).

============================================================

  

    Definition 8.2.9. A set \(A \subseteq X\) is {{c5::dense}} in the metric space \((X, d)\) if {{c1::\(\bar{A}\)}} = {{c2::\(X\)}}. A subset \(E\) of a metric space \((X, d)\) is {{c4::nowhere}}-{{c5::dense}} in \(X\) if {{c3::\(\bar{E}^{\circ}\)}} is {{c4::empty}}.

    In Section 3.5, we proved {{c5::Baire's}} Theorem, which states that it is impossible to write the {{c4::real numbers \(\mathbf{R}\)}} as the {{c1::countable}} {{c2::union}} of {{c3::nowhere-dense}} sets.

============================================================

  

    We knew that \(\mathbf{R}\) was too big to be written as the countable union of {{c1::single points}} ( \(\mathbf{R}\) is {{c1::uncountable}}), but {{c5::Baire's}} Theorem improves on this by asserting that the only way to make \(\mathbf{R}\) from a countable union of arbitrary sets is for the {{c2::closure}} of {{c4::at least one}} of these sets to contain {{c3::an interval.<br>}}

    Theorem 8.2.11 ({{c5::Baire Category}} Theorem). A {{c4::complete}} {{c5::metric space}} is not the {{c2::union}} of a {{c3::countable}} collection of {{c1::nowhere-dense}} sets.

============================================================

  

    This result is called the Baire Category Theorem because it creates two categories of size for subsets in a metric space. A set of "{{c4::first}} category" is one that can be written as a {{c1::countable union}} of {{c2::nowhere-dense}} sets. These are the {{c3::small}}, intuitively {{c3::thin}} subsets of a metric space. We now see that if our metric space is {{c5::complete}}, then it is necessarily of "{{c4::second}} category," meaning it cannot be written as a {{c1::countable union}} of {{c2::nowhere-dense}} sets.

============================================================

  

    Given a subset \(A\) of a complete metric space \(X\), showing that \(A\) is of {{c5::{{c1::first}}}} category is a mathematically precise way of demonstrating that \(A\) constitutes a very {{c4::{{c2::minor}}}} portion of the set \(X\). The term "{{c4::{{c3::meager}}}}" is often used to mean a set of {{c1::first}} category.

============================================================

  

    With the stage set, we now outline the argument that continuous functions that are {{c5::{{c2::differentiable}}}} at {{c4::{{c3::even one}}}} point of \([0,1]\) form a {{c4::{{c1::meager}}}} subset of the metric space \(C[0,1]\).

    {{c3::Finite}} sets contain {{c4::both}} their {{c5::{{c2::supremum}}}} and {{c5::{{c1::infimum}}}}, thus they must have a {{c5::{{c2::maximum}}}} and a {{c5::{{c1::minimum}}}}

============================================================

  

    When processing on {{c5::{{c2::finite}}}} sets, the process is {{c4::{{c3::guaranteed}}}} to {{c4::{{c1::terminate}}}}

    The concept of a {{c1::compact}} set is meant to extend our {{c4::intuition}} from {{c5::{{c2::finite}}}} sets to {{c5::{{c3::infinite}}}} sets

    A set K of a metric space is {{c5::{{c3::compact}}}} if every {{c4::{{c2::open cover}}}} of K has a {{c4::{{c1::finite subcover}}}}

    To show that a set is {{c4::not-compact}} you just need to show there {{c5::exists}} a {{c2::single}} {{c3::open-cover}} without a {{c1::finite subcover}}

============================================================

  

    Every set has a {{c4::guaranteed}} {{c3::finite}} cover in the form of the set containing the {{c1::entire metric space {X}}}, this is why {{c5::compactness}} requires {{c2::all}} open covers to have {{c3::finite sub-covers}}

============================================================

  

    Warning: a set which has a {{c2::finite cover}} is not necessarily {{c1::compact}}, {{c5::{{c4::all}}}} {{c5::{{c3::open covers}}}} must have {{c2::finite subcovers}} for {{c1::compactness}} to hold
