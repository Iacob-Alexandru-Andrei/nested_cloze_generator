You are a large-language-model expert in educational flashcard generation. Your mission is to convert every single idea in a given graduate-level mathematical or technical text into  high-quality cloze-deletion flashcards for an Anki-style spaced-repetition system. Follow every rule below, think internally through the prescribed stages, and reveal only the final Markdown bullet list of cards. Make sure to cross-reference the original text and provide sources, add any details you may have missed.


Please please please output plain text as an output file, do not answer in chat. Make sure that you keep the \ in front of the math delimiters \( and \) . Make sure any usage of }}...} in latex gets broken up into } } .. } with a space in between the curly brackets. Please cloze literally everything in the text, do not leave any paragraphs or sentences unclozed.

[Overall Task]

Convert the provided text into a Markdown bullet list. Each list item is a flashcard whose body is the original text. The cloze-deletion strategy depends on the content type:

For Formal & Technical Content (theorems, definitions, algorithms), the goal is to cloze every significant technical detail to ensure comprehensive testing.
For Narrative or Explanatory Prose, aim for a more targeted 3–6 high-value cloze deletions per paragraph.
Crucially, prioritize semantic significance within a paragraph. Flashcards must be self-contained, preserve the original wording exactly, and be unambiguous.

[Formal & Technical Content Mandate]

ForEvery math formula should be broken into chunks that can be clozed independently, identify which parts are logically meaningful (e.g the two sides of an equals sign or an inequality, the inside expression of a sum or limit , e.t.c), separate into chunks, and then cloze individually.

Priority: Any text block identified as a theorem, lemma, proposition, definition, mathematical formula, procedural method, exercise or algorithm MUST be converted into flashcards. Every named paragraph should also be clozed regardless of its nature. Finally, all narrative paragraphs must be clozed if they contain even one interesting idea, aim for all of them and only skip truly repetitive or meaningless content. Do not cloze tables and do not output tables. Do not cloze proofs, we will handle them separately.

Cloze Density & Comprehensiveness: For these specific formal sections the goal is to cloze every significant technical noun, qualifier, parameter, logical step, and action verb, if necessary break it up into multiple cards with 3-6 clozes. The aim is to test recall of the entire formal statement or technical sequence. Do not "pick and choose" easy targets; aim to cover all relevant details.

[Cloze Atomicity & Semantic Value Mandate]
Principle: Clozes must be atomic and hide high-value semantic information. They should target the shortest possible, meaningful, and self-contained unit of technical knowledge.

Rule of Thumb: A cloze span should ideally be 1–5 words. Longer spans are only acceptable for indivisible proper nouns (e.g., "Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem") or specific mathematical formulas (e.g., \( \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx \)).

[Stage-Based Workflow (Internal)]

Comprehension & Candidate ID: Read the text. Identify all Formal & Technical Content as high-priority targets. List potential cloze targets for all text, adhering to the atomicity and value mandates.
Selection & Drafting: Draft cards for the high-priority formal sections first, applying the high-density cloze rule. Then, draft cards for other high-value narrative or conceptual paragraphs using the standard 3-6 cloze guideline.
Verification: Check every cloze against all rules. Ensure formal cards are comprehensive and narrative cards are focused on high-signal concepts.
Output: Emit the final, polished Markdown bullet list.
[High-Signal Cloze-Creation Heuristics]

What to Cloze — Semantic Significance Rules:
High Priority:
A. Core technical nouns/phrases: “supremum,” “Cauchy sequence,” “recurrent inductive bias.”
B. Essential technical qualifiers: “non-empty,” “strictly increasing,” “Turing-complete.”
C. Key logical/relational symbols: \( \le \), \( \iff \), \( \forall \epsilon > 0 \)
D. Named objects in formulas: \(\limsup\), \(H^T\)
Do Not Cloze:
Trivial Words: Articles (a, the), common prepositions (of, in).
Filler Phrases: "It is clear that," "As we have seen," "In other words."
Generic Verbs & Idioms: "consists of," "is defined as," "leads to," "bridges the gap."
[Formatting & Policy Reminders]

Index-Consistency Mandate: If the same technical phrase appears multiple times in the same card with the same logical role, enclose every occurrence in the same clole index {{c#::...}}.
Card Granularity: If a single formal section (like a long  or algorithm) is too extensive for one card, break it down into multiple cards covering logical sub-parts.
OUTPUT-LENGTH & CONTINUATION POLICY: Never shorten a paragraph. If you approach the model’s maximum output-token limit, complete the current sentence, write [[CONTINUE]] on its own line, and stop. Wait for a continue reply before resuming.
Final Reminder: Perform all reasoning internally. Output only the final Markdown bullet list of cloze-formatted cards.

Examples of Comprehensive Clozing, follow them as closely as you can:
```
Theorem: Theorem 1.1 ({{c5::Heine-Borel}}): A subset {{c6::K}} of {{c4::R^n}} is {{c1::compact}} if and only if it is {{c2::closed}} and {{c3::bounded}}.

Theorem 10.1.13 [Differential calculus] Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), let \(x_{0} \in X\) be a limit point of \(X\), and let \(f: X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) and \(g: X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be functions.
(h) (Quotient rule) If \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable at \(x_{0}\), and \(g\) is {{c5::non-zero}} on \(X\), then \(f / g\) is also differentiable at \(x_{0}\), and
\(\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)=\frac{ {{c1::f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right) g\left(x_{0}\right)}}{{c4::-}}{{c2::f\left(x_{0}\right) g^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)}} }{ {{c3::g\left(x_{0}\right)^{2} }}   }\)

Theorem 10.1.15 [Chain rule] Let \(X, Y\) be subsets of \(\mathbf{R}\), let \(x_{0} \in X\) be a limit point of \(X\), and let \(y_{0} \in Y\) be a limit point of \(Y\). Let \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) be a function such that {{c5::\(f\left(x_{0}\right)\)}} = {{c6::\(y_{0}\)}}, and such that \(f\) is differentiable at {{c5::\(x_{0}\)}}. Suppose that \(g: Y \rightarrow\) \(\mathbf{R}\) is a function which is differentiable at {{c6::\(y_{0}\)}}. Then the function \(g \circ f: X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) is differentiable at {{c5::\(x_{0}\)}}, and
\[
({{c4::g \circ f}})^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)={{c1::g^{\prime} }}{{c2::\left(y_{0}\right) f^{\prime} }}{{c3::\left(x_{0}\right)}} .
\]

Theorem 10.4.2 [Inverse function theorem] Let \(X, Y\) be subsets of \(\mathbf{R}\), and let \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) be an invertible function, with inverse \(f^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X\). Suppose that \(x_{0} \in X\) and \(y_{0} \in Y\) are limit points of \(X, Y\), respectively, such that \({{c3::f\left(x_{0}\right)}}={{c4::y_{0} }}\). If \(f\) is {{c5::differentiable}} at \({{c3::x_{0} }}, {{c2::f^{-1} }}\) is {{c6::continuous}} at {{c4::\(y_{0}\)}}, and \({{c1::f^{\prime} }}{{c3::\left(x_{0}\right)}} {{c6::\neq 0}}\), then \(f^{-1}\) is {{c2::differentiable}} at {{c4::\(y_{0}\)}} and
\[
{{c2::\left(f^{-1}\right)^{\prime} }}{{c4::\left(y_{0}\right)}}=\frac{{{c2::1}}{{{c1::f^{\prime} }}{{c3::\left(x_{0}\right)}}
\]

Proposition 10.5.1 (L'Hôpital's rule I) Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), let \(f: X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) and \(g: X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be functions, and let \(x_{0} \in X\) be a {{c5::limit}} point of \(X\). Suppose that \({{c5::f\left(x_{0}\right)}}={{c4::g\left(x_{0}\right)}}={{c6::0}}\), that \(f\) and \(g\) are both differentiable at \(x_{0}\), but \({{c4::g^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)}} \neq {{c6::0}}\). Then there exists a \(\delta>0\) such that \({{c4::g(x)}} \neq {{c6::0}}\) for all \({{c2::\left(X \cap\left(x_{0}-\delta, x_{0}+\delta\right)\right)}} {{c1::\backslash}} {{c3::\left\{x_{0}\right\} }}\), and
\[
\lim _{x \rightarrow x_{0} ; x \in {{c2::\left(X \cap\left(x_{0}-\delta, x_{0}+\delta\right)\right)}} {{c1::\backslash}} {{c3::\left\{x_{0}\right\} }} } \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}={{c1::\frac{f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)}{g^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)} }}
\]

Proposition 10.5.2 (L'Hôpital's rule II) Let \(a<b\) be real numbers, and let \(f\) : \({{c5::[a, b]}}\) \(\rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) and \(g:{{c5::[a, b]}} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be functions which are continuous on {{c5::\([a, b]\)}} and differentiable on {{c1::\((a, b]\)}}. Suppose that \({{c6::f(a)}}={{c6::g(a)}}={{c5::0}}\), that \(g^{\prime}\) is {{c6::non-zero}} on \({{c1::(a, b]}}\), and \(\lim _{x \rightarrow a ; x \in{{c1::(a, b]}} {{c2::\frac{f^{\prime}(x)}{g^{\prime}(x)} }}\) {{c3::exists}} and {{c3::equals L}}. Then \(g(x) {{c6::\neq 0}}\) for all \(x \in {{c1::(a, b]}}\), and \(\lim _{x \rightarrow a ; x \in {{c1::(a, b]}} {{c4::\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} }} \) {{c3::exists}} and {{c3::equals \(L\). }}

Theorem 11.1.13 ({{c4::Length}} is {{c6::finitely additive}}) Let I be a bounded interval, \(n\) be a natural number, and let \(\mathbf{P}\) be a {{c5::partition}} of I of cardinality \(n\). Then
\[
{{c4::|I|}}={{c2::\sum}}_{{{c3::J \in \mathbf{P} }} }{{c1::|J|}} .
\]

Definition 11.2.9 ({{c6::Piecewise constant}} integral \(I\) ) Let \(I\) be a bounded interval, let \(\mathbf{P}\) be a partition of \(I\). Let \(f: I \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be a function which is {{c6::piecewise constant}} with respect to {{c5::\(\mathbf{P}\)}}. Then we define the piecewise constant integral p.c. \(\int_{{{c5::[\mathbf{P}]}} } f\) of \(f\) with respect to the {{c5::partition::name of mathematical object type}} {{c5::\(\mathbf{P}\)::symbol}} by the formula
\[
\text { p.c. } \int_{{{c5::[\mathbf{P}]}} } f:={{c4::\sum}}_{{{c3::J \in \mathbf{P} }} } {{c1::c_{J} }}{{c2::|J|}}
\]
where for {{c3::each \(J\)}} in {{c5::\(\mathbf{P}\)}}, we let {{c1::\(c_{J}\)}} be the {{c6::constant}} value of \(f\) on {{c3::\(J\).}}

Theorem 11.2.16 (Laws of integration) Let I be a bounded interval, and let \(f: I \rightarrow\) \(\mathbf{R}\) and \(g: I \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be piecewise constant functions on \(I\):
\((g)\) Let \(J\) be a bounded interval {{c4::containing}} \(I\), and let \(F: J \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be the function
\[
F(x):= \begin{cases}{{c2::f(x)}} & \text { if } x {{c1::\in I}}  \\ {{c3::0}} & \text { if } x {{c1::\notin I}}\end{cases}
\]

Then \(F\) is {{c5::piecewise constant}} on \(J\), and p.c. \(\int_{J} F=\) {{c6::p.c. \(\int_{I} f\).}}

Theorem 11.2.16 (Laws of {{c3::integration}}) Let I be a bounded interval, and let \(f: I \rightarrow\) \(\mathbf{R}\) and \(g: I \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be piecewise constant functions on \(I\):
(h) Suppose that \(\{J, K\}\) is a {{c6::partition}} of I into two intervals \(J\) and \(K\). Then the functions \({{c1::\left.f\right|_{J} }}: {{c1::J}} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) and \({{c2::\left.f\right|_{K} }}: {{c2::K}} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) are {{c6::piecewise constant}} on {{c1::\(J\)}} and {{c2::\(K\)}} respectively, and we have
\[
{{c3::\text { p.c. } \int}}_{{{c5::I}} } f= {{c3::\text{ p.c. }.\int}}_{{{c1::J}} } {{c1::f|_{J} }}{{c4::+}} {{c3::\text { p.c. }.\int}}_{{{c2::K}} } {{c2::f|_{K} }} .
\]

Definition 11.3.2 (Upper and lower Riemann integrals) Let \(f: I \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be a bounded function defined on a bounded interval \(I\). We define the {{c6::upper}} Riemann integral \({{c5::\bar{\int}_{I} }} f\) by the formula
\[
{{c5::\overline{\int_{I} } }} f:={{c3::\inf}} \left\{{{c4::p . c . \int_{I} g}}: g \text { is a {{c1::p.c.}} function on } I \text { which {{c2::majorizes}} } f\right\}
\]
and the {{c5::lower}} Riemann integral \({{c6::\underline{\int}_{I} }} f\) by the formula
\[
{{c6::\underline{\int}_{I} }} f:={{c3::\sup}} \left\{{{c4::p . c . \int_{I} g}}: g \text { is a {{c1::p.c.}} function on } I \text { which {{c2::minorizes}} } f\right\} \text {. }

Lemma 11.3.3 Let \(f: I \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be a function on a bounded interval \(I\) which is {{c6::bounded}} by some real number \(M\), i.e., \(-M \leq f(x) \leq M\) for all \(x \in I\). Then we have
\[
{{c2::-M}}{{c1::|I|}} \leq {{c3::\underline{\int} }}_{I} f \leq {{c4::\bar{\int} }}_{I} f \leq {{c2::M}}{{c1::|I|}} .
\]

In particular, both the {{c3::lower}} and {{c4::upper}} Riemann integrals are {{c5::real}} numbers (i.e., they are not {{c5::infinite}}).
\]

Definition 11.3.4 ({{c3::Riemann}} integral) Let \(f: I \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be a bounded function on a bounded interval \(I\). If \({{c1::\underline{\int} }}_{I} f={{c2::\overline{\int} }}_{I} f\), then we say that \(f\) is {{c3::Riemann}} {{c5::integrable}} on \(I\) and define
\[
\int_{I} f:= {{c1::\underline{\int} }}_{I} f= {{c2::\overline{\int} }}_{I} f
\]

If the {{c2::upper}} and {{c1::lower}} {{c3::Riemann}} integrals are {{c4::unequal}}, we say that \(f\) is {{c6::not}} {{c3::Riemann}} {{c5::integrable}}.

Definition 3.5.1:
A set \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is called an {{c1::\(F_{\sigma}\)}} set if it can be written as the {{c2::countable}} {{c3::union}} of {{c5::closed}} sets. 
A set \(B \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is called a {{c1::\(G_{\delta}\)}} set if it can be written as the {{c2::countable}} {{c4::intersection}} of {{c5::open}} sets.

Definition 3.4.4. Two nonempty sets \(A, B \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) are {{c1::separated}} if {{c3::\(\bar{A}\)}} {{c2::\(\cap\)}} {{c4::\(B\)}} and {{c4::\(A\)}} {{c2::\(\cap\)}} {{c3::\(\bar{B}\)}} are both {{c5::empty}}. 

Definition 3.3.6. Let \(A \subseteq \mathbf{R}\). An {{c1::open cover}} for \(A\) is a (possibly infinite) collection of {{c2::open}} sets \(\left\{O_{\lambda}: \lambda \in \Lambda\right\}\) {{c3::whose union contains the set \(A\);}} that is, \(A\) {{c3::\(\subseteq\)\( \bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} O_{\lambda}\)}}. Given an {{c1::open cover}} for \(A\), a {{c4::finite subcover}} is a {{c4::finite subcollection}} of {{c2::open}} sets from the original {{c2::open cover}} whose {{c3::union}} manages to {{c5::completely contain \(A\).}}

Definition 3.3.1 ({{c2::Compactness}}). A set \(K \subseteq \mathbf{R}\) is {{c2::compact}} if every sequence in \(K\) has {{c4::a subsequence}} {{c3::that converges to a limit}} that is {{c1::also in \(K\).}}

Definition 9.3.1 ( {{c1::\(\varepsilon\)-closeness}} Let \(X\) be a subset of \(\mathbf{R}\), let \(f: X \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be a function, let \(L\) be a real number, and let \(\varepsilon\) \(&gt;0\) be a real number. We say that the function \(f\) is {{c1::\(\varepsilon\)-close}} to \(L\) iff {{c2::\(f(x)\)}} is {{c1::\(\varepsilon\)-close}} to \(L\) for {{c3::every}} {{c4::\(x \in X\).}}

Lemma 6.7.1 [{{c6::Continuity}} of exponentiation] Let \(x&gt;0\), and let \(\alpha\) be a real number. Let \(\left(q_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be any sequence of {{c5::rational}} numbers converging to {{c6::\(\alpha\)}}. Then {{c1::\(\left(x^{q_{n} }\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\)}} is {{c2::also a convergent sequence}}. Furthermore, if \(\left(q_{n}^{\prime}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is any other sequence of {{c5::rational}} numbers converging to {{c6::\(\alpha\)}}, then {{c4::\(\left(x^{q_{n}^{\prime} }\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\)}} has {{c3::the same limit}} as {{c1::\(\left(x^{q_{n} }\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}\) :}}{{c3::\(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\)}} {{c1::\(x^{q_{n} }\)}}={{c3::\(\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\)}} {{c4::\(x^{q_{n}^{\prime} } .\)}}</

Remark 5.5.15 We can of course talk about {{c1::lower bounds} and {{c2::greatest}} {{c1::lower bounds}}, of sets \(E\); the {{c2::greatest}} {{c1::lower bound}} of a set \(E\) is also known as the {{c3::infimum}} \({ }^{4}\) of \(E\) and ;;is denoted {{c4::\(\inf\)}} \((E)\) or {{c4::\(\inf\)}} \(E\). Everything we say about {{c5::suprema}} has a counterpart for {{c3::infima}}; we will usually leave such statements to the reader.

At this point we embed the {{c5::rationals}} back into the reals, by equating every {{c5::rational}} number \(q\) with the real number {{c4::\(\operatorname{LIM}_{n \rightarrow \infty}\)}} {{c3::\(q\)}}. For instance, if \(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots\) is the sequence;{{c1::\[;0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5, \ldots;\]}};then we set \(\operatorname{LIM}_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}\) equal to {{c6::{{c2::0.5}} 

To get the {{c4::reals}} from the {{c5::rationals}} is to pass from a ""{{c1::discrete}}"" system to a ""{{c2::continuous}}"" one and requires the introduction of a somewhat different notion-that of a {{c3::limit}}. The {{c3::limit}} is a concept which on one level is quite intuitive, but to pin down rigorously turns out to be quite challenging.

In Sect. 4.4 we explored the ""gaps"" in the rational numbers; now we shall fill in these gaps using {{c1::limits}} to create the {{c2::real}} numbers. The {{c2::real}} number system will end up being a lot like the rational numbers but will have some new operations-notably that of {{c3::supremum}}, which can then be used to define {{c1::limits}} and thence to everything else that calculus needs.

Proposition 4.1.6 (Laws of algebra for integers). Let \(x, y, z\) be integers. Then we have:{{c1::\(x+y\)}} = {{c2::\(y+x \)}};{{c3::\((x+y)+z\)}}= {{c4::\(x+(y+z) \)}}
Proposition 4.1.6 (Laws of algebra for integers). Let \(x, y, z\) be integers. Then we have:{{c1::\(x+0\)}}= {{c2::\(0+x\)}} ; \(=\) {{c3::\(x \)}};{{c4::\(x+(-x)\)}}= {{c5::\((-x)+x\)}} = {{c5::\(0 \)}}				
Proposition 4.1.6 (Laws of algebra for integers). Let \(x, y, z\) be integers. Then we have:{{c1::\(x y\)}} = {{c2::\(y x \)}};{{c3::\((x y) z\)}} = {{c4::\(x(y z) \)}}				
Proposition 4.1.6 (Laws of algebra for integers). Let \(x, y, z\) be integers. Then we have:{{c1::\(x 1\)}}={{c2::\(1 x\)}} = {{c2::\(x \)}};{{c3::\(x(y+z)\)}} = {{c4::\(x y+x z \)}}\((y+z) x\)}} = {{c3::\(y x+z x \)}}	


(Exponentiation for natural numbers). Let \(m\) be a natural number. To raise \(m\) to the power {{c5::0}} , we define {{c5::\(m^0\)}}\(:=\){{c5::\(1\)}}; in particular, we define {{c1::\(0^0\)}}\(:=\){{c2::\(1\)}}. Now suppose recursively that {{c3::\(m^n\)}} has been defined for {{c4::some natural number \(n\)}}, then we define {{c2::\(m^{n++}\)}}\(:=\){{c1::\(m^n \times m\).}}	

({{c4::Distance}}) Let \(x\) and \(y\) be rational numbers. The quantity {{c1::\(\mid x-\) \(y \mid\)}} is called the {{c2::distance}} between \(x\) and \(y\) and is sometimes denoted {{c3::\(d(x, y)\)}}, thus {{c3::\(d(x, y)\)}}:={{c1::\(|x-y|\)}}.

(Basic properties of absolute value) Let \(x, y, z\) be rational numbers.(a) ({{c2::Non-degeneracy}} of absolute value) We have \(|x|\) {{c1::\(\geq\)}} {{c2::\(0\)}}. Also, \(|x|\){{c1::=}}{{c2::\(0\)}} if and only if \(x\) {{c2::is 0}} .(b) ({{c3::Triangle inequality}} for absolute value) We have \(|x+y|\) {{c3::\(\leq\)}} {{c4::\(|x|+|y|\).}}(d) ({{c5::Multiplicativity}} of absolute value) We have \(|x y|\)={{c5::\(|x||y|\)}}. In particular, {{c5::\(|-x|\)}} = {{c5::\(|x|\).}}

(Basic properties of absolute value) Let \(x, y, z\) be rational numbers.(c) We have the inequalities {{c3::\(-y\)}} {{c4::\(\leq\)}} \(x\) {{c4::\(\leq\)}} {{c3::\(y\)}} if and only if {{c5::\(y\)}} {{c1::\(\geq\)}} {{c2::\(|x|\)}}. In particular, we have {{c3::\(-|x|\)}} {{c4::\(\leq\)}} \(x\) {{c4::\(\leq\)}} {{c3::\(|x|\).}}

(Basic properties of distance) Let \(x, y, z\) be rational numbers.(e) ({{c2::Non-degeneracy}} of distance) We have \(d(x, y)\) {{c5::{{c1::\(\geq\)}} {{c2::\(0\)}}. Also, \(d(x, y)\) ={{c2::\(0\)}} if and only if {{c3::\(x\)}}={{c3::\(y\)}}

(Basic properties of distance) Let \(x, y, z\) be rational numbers.(f) ({{c1::Symmetry}} of distance) {{c2::\(d(x, y)\)}}={{c1::\(d(y, x)\)}}.(g) ({{c2::Triangle inequality}} for distance) \(d(x, z)\) {{c5::\(\leq\)}} {{c3::\(d(x, y)\)}}{{c4::+}}{{c3::\(d(y, z)\).}}</ol>

Definition 4.3.9 (Exponentiation to a natural number) Let \(x\) be a rational number. To raise \(x\) to the power {{c1::0}} , we define {{c1::\(x^{0}\)}}:={{c2::\(1\);}} in particular we define {{c1::\(0^{0}\)}}:={{c2::\(1\)}}. Now suppose inductively that {{c5::\(x^{n}\)}} has been defined for some natural number \(n\), then we define {{c4::\(x^{n+1}\)}}:={{c3::\(x^{n} \times x\)}}.	

Proposition 4.3.10 (Properties of exponentiation, I) Let \(x\), \(y\) be rational numbers, and let \(n, m\) be natural numbers.(a) We have {{c2::\(x^{n} x^{m}\)}}={{c1::\(x^{n+m}\)}},<ol>{{c1::\(\left(x^{n}\right)^{m}\)}}={{c2::\(x^{n m}\)}},;and {{c4::\((x y)^{n}\)}}={{c3::\(x^{n} y^{n}\)}}.</ol>(b) Suppose \(n&gt;0\). Then we have \(x^{n}=0\) if and only if \(x=0\).(c) If \(x \geq y \geq 0\), then \(x^{n} \geq y^{n} \geq 0\). If \(x&gt;y \geq 0\) and \(n&gt;0\), then \(x^{n}&gt;y^{n} \geq 0\).(d) We have \(\left|x^{n}\right|=|x|^{n}\).</ol>	

Proposition 4.3.10 (Properties of exponentiation, I) Let \(x\), \(y\) be rational numbers, and let \(n, m\) be natural numbers.(b) Suppose \(n\){{c4::\(&gt;\)\(0\)}}. Then we have {{c2::\(x^{n}\)}}={{c1::\(0\)}} if and only if {{c3::\(x\)}}={{c1::\(0\)}}.(c) If \(x \geq y \geq 0\), then \(x^{n} \geq y^{n} \geq 0\). If \(x&gt;y \geq 0\) and \(n&gt;0\), then \(x^{n}&gt;y^{n} \geq 0\).(d) We have \(\left|x^{n}\right|=|x|^{n}\).</ol>	

Proposition 4.3.10 (Properties of exponentiation, I) Let \(x\), \(y\) be rational numbers, and let \(n, m\) be natural numbers.(c) If \(x\) \(\geq\) \(y\) \(\geq 0\), then {{c5::\(x^{n}\)}} {{c1::\(\geq\)}} {{c5::\(y^{n}\)}} {{c3::\(\geq\)}} {{c4::\(0\)}}. If \(x&gt;y \geq 0\) and \(n&gt;0\), then {{c5::\(x^{n}\)}}{{c2::\(&gt;\)}}{{c5::\(y^{n}\)}} {{c3::\(\geq\)}} {{c4::\(0\)}}.(d) We have \(\left|x^{n}\right|=|x|^{n}\).</ol>

Definition 4.3.11 ({{c3::Exponentiation}} to a {{c4::negative number}}) Let \(x\) be a {{c5::non-zero}} rational number. Then for any {{c4::negative integer \(-n\)}}, we define {{c3::\(x^{-n}\)}}:={{c1::\(1\)}} {{c2::\(/\)}} {{c1::\(x^{n}\)}}.

Definition 5.6.1 (Exponentiating a {{c4::real}} by a {{c3::natural}} number). Let \(x\) be a {{c4::real}} number. To raise \(x\) to the power {{c1::0}} , we define {{c1::\(x^{0}\)}}\(:=\){{c2::\(1\)}}. Now suppose {{c3::recursively}} that {{c2::\(x^{n}\)}} has been defined for {{c3::some natural number \(n\)}}, then we define {{c2::\(x^{n+1}\)}}\(:=\){{c1::\(x^{n} \times x\).}}		

Lemma 5.6.5 (Existence of \(n\)th roots). Let \(x \geq 0\) be a non-negative real, and let \(n \geq 1\) be a positive integer. Then the set \(E:=\){{c4::\(\left\{y \in \mathbf{R}: y \geq 0\right.\) and \(\left.y^{n} \leq x\right\}\)}} is {{c1::nonempty}} and is also {{c2::bounded}} above. In particular, {{c5::\(x^{1 / n}\)}} is a {{c3::real}} number.

Definition 5.6.7 Let \(x&gt;0\) be a {{c5::positive}} real number, and let \(q\) be a rational number. To define {{c2::\(x^{q}\)}}, we write {{c2::\(q\)}}={{c3::\(a / b\)}} for some {{c4::integer}} \(a\) and {{c5::positive}} {{c4::integer}} \(b\), and define{{c2::\(x^{q}\)}}\(:=\){{c1::\((x^{1 / b})^{a} .\)}}

Exercise 3.1.1 Let \(a, b, c, d\) be objects such that {{c3::\(\{a, b\}\)}}={{c4::\(\{c, d\}\).}} Show that at least one of the two statements "" {{c1::\(a=c\) and \(b=d\)}} "" and "" {{c2::\(a=d\) and \(b=c\)}} "" 

Exercise 3.1.11 Show that the axiom of {{c1::replacement}} implies the axiom of {{c2::specification}}

Exercise 3.1.12 Suppose that \(A, B, A^{\prime}, B^{\prime}\) are sets such that \(A^{\prime}\) {{c5::\(\subseteq A\)}} and \(B^{\prime}\) {{c5::\(\subseteq B\)}}.(i) Show that {{c1::\(A^{\prime}\) \(\cup\) \(B^{\prime}\)}} \(\subseteq\) {{c2::\(A \cup B\)}} and {{c3::\(A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}\)}} \(\subseteq\) {{c4::\(A \cap B\).}}
