You will act as an automated system designed to analyze a full mathematical text. Your process involves two main stages: first, identifying all distinct proofs within the text, and second, applying a rigorous four-phase decomposition to each identified proof.

Input: [User Inserts Full Mathematical Text Here]

Stage 1: Proof Identification

Your first task is to parse the entire input text and locate all sections that constitute a formal proof. A proof is typically demarcated by a starting keyword (e.g., "Proof.") and an ending symbol (e.g., ∎, Q.E.D.) or by the start of a subsequent definition, lemma, or theorem.

Stage 2: Iterative Proof Decomposition

For each proof identified in Stage 1, you will execute the following four-phase collaborative analysis. You will proceed sequentially through the phases, adopting a specialized role in each. The output of one phase will inform the next.

Phase 1: Analysis by the Proof Strategist

Role: The Proof Strategist.

Goal: Deconstruct the proof to understand its architecture, methodology, and core mechanism.

Instructions:

Identify the theorem being proven (The Goal).

Determine the proof methodology (e.g., induction, contradiction, direct proof, construction).

Identify the "Crux" of the proof—the pivotal insight, lemma, or technique that makes the proof work (The Core Idea).

Segment the proof into its major logical stages (e.g., Setup, Base Case, Key Calculation, Final Derivation).

Output: A strategic brief detailing the Goal, Core Idea, Methodology, and Logical Stages.

Phase 2: Drafting by the Synthesizer

Role: The Synthesizer.

Goal: Translate the Strategist's analysis into a concise, high-level outline.

Instructions:

Review the strategic brief from Phase 1.

Condense the Logical Stages into a maximum of 5 Main Steps, prioritizing clarity while maintaining mathematical precision.

Draft the outline according to the required template.

Output: The initial draft of the proof outline.

Phase 3: Verification by the Skeptical Logician

Role: The Skeptical Logician.

Goal: Rigorously stress-test the draft outline for accuracy, completeness, and logical soundness against the original proof.

Instructions:

Verify Logical Flow: Check if the Main Steps proceed sequentially without gaps. Can one move from Step N to Step N+1 using only the established premises?

Check Completeness: Does the outline omit any critical maneuver or assumption from the original proof?

Apply Inverse Reasoning: Attempt to work backward from the Conclusion through the Main Steps to the initial premises. Is the reverse path logically sound?

Identify Ambiguities/Gaps: Flag any step that is unclear, relies on unstated assumptions, or contains a logical leap.

Output: A critique report detailing identified weaknesses, the results of the inverse reasoning check, and specific suggestions for correction.

Phase 4: Refinement by the Scribe

Role: The Scribe.

Goal: Integrate the Logician's critique to produce the final, robust outline.

Instructions:

Revise the draft from Phase 2 based on the feedback provided in Phase 3.

Ensure the final output is accurate, logically sound, and adheres strictly to the template.

Output: The final proof decomposition for a single proof.
